  Our third-ever DCJ World Finals started off with <i>Baby Blocks</i> and
  <i>Lemming</i>, both of which would have been relatively straightforward as
  non-distributed problems, but which were somewhat difficult to distribute
  efficiently and correctly. <i>Median</i> was yet another 2017 DCJ problem
  in which nodes did not all behave the same way; contestants had to figure out
  how different nodes were storing their data before they could even begin to
  use all of those nodes to find the median. Finally, <i>Lisp+++</i> took a
  <a href="../2016_r2/lisp_plus_plus/statement.html" target="_blank">previous DCJ problem</a>
  and added what looked like a minor twist... but that small change actually
  made the problem much, much more challenging to solve!
</p><p>
  In general, contestants found problems B and C approachable, but D and E were
  much more difficult. <b>bmerry</b> held the scoreboard lead for much of the
  contest; he was unable to solve E-small, but he was the first to submit
  everything else, reaching a total of 67 points. Other contestants were stuck
  at 38 (B + C) or 48 (B + C + D-small), but in the last 20 minutes, three E-small
  solutions appeared from <b>ecnerwala</b>, <b>eatmore</b>, and
  <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b>. E-large was so hard that it did not even get a wild
  last-minute attempt! The contest was so tough that no contestant submitted more
  than six out of the eight possible datasets.
</p><p>
  As usual for a Distributed Code Jam World Finals round, though, a lot changed
  in the judging phase. Many contestants got both B-large and C-large right, but
  nobody got D-large... so it all came down to D-small and E-small! <b>ecnerwala</b>
  was the only contestant to solve both of those plus B and C, and he became our new
  Distributed Code Jam World Champion, with 59 points. <b>eatmore</b> took second
  with 49; <b>krijgertje</b> had the fastest of the 48-point scores, so he took third.
</p><p>
  That brings our 2017 Distributed contest to a close. We continue to be
  impressed with how well our contestants have handled harder and harder
  distributed problems over the years! We hope you will join us again next
  year; remember that 100 nodes means 100 times (or, perhaps more realistically,
  10 times) the fun!
