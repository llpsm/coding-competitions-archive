<h3>Problem</h3>
<h2>Median</h2>
<p>
  In this year's online rounds, we ran into trouble with queries of death and
  broken memory, so to make it up to you, we decided to put a very easy
  median-finding problem in the Finals. We were determined to avoid any
  more issues with peach smoothie spills, so we asked our DCJ (Data Curating
  Janitor) to set up two special arrays of 100 nodes for this problem, one for
  each of the Small and Large datasets.
</p><p>
  Our DCJ prepared each array according to our instruction:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose N pieces of data to store. Since the problem is about
    finding a median, each of the N pieces of data is a non-negative integer.
    (The same number might appear more than once in the data.) N is also
    guaranteed to be odd, because who likes finding the median of an even
    number of integers?</li>
  <li>A median-finding problem would be far too easy if the data were given
    in order, so, choose one of the N! permutations of the data uniformly at
    (pseudo-)random.</li>
  <li>Write these N pieces of data, in the order of the chosen permutation,
    clockwise around the edge of a circular disk, starting from a
    <i>fixed point</i> on the very bottom.</li>
  <li>Make one exact copy of that disk for each node to use. </li>
  <li>A contestant can call GetData(i) on a node. Each disk has a data-reading
    needle that starts at the same fixed point. That node will move its
    data-reading needle to read and return the data i places away (clockwise)
    from the fixed point, and then the data-reading needle will go back to
    the fixed point. Since the disk is a circle, it is allowed for i to be
    greater than or equal to N; the node will return the (i % N)th piece of
    data. For example, for N = 5, calls to GetData(0) and GetData(5) would
    return the same piece of data.</li>
  <li>A contestant can also call GetN() to learn the value of N.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Our DCJ (Data Curating Janitor) completed these tasks the night before the
  Finals, and, to celebrate, we threw a party and brought in a DCJ (Disc
  Controlling Jockey) to play some music. Unfortunately, this morning, we
  learned that the Disc Controlling Jockey mistook our array of nodes for the
  Large dataset for a very elaborate turntable, and might have spun any or all
  of the disks! This means that, <u>for the Large dataset only</u>, even though
  all the nodes' disks have the same data in the same clockwise order,
  <i>their fixed points might no longer be the same</i>. For example, a piece
  of data that one node thinks is the 0th might be the 3rd on another node!
</p><p>
  Moreover, we forgot to ban flavors of smoothie other than peach, and our
  Disc Controlling Jockey also spilled a strawberry smoothie all over the array
  of nodes for the Large dataset. Because of this,
  <u>for the Large dataset only</u>, the GetN() function no longer returns any
  useful data.
</p><p>
  The Finals have already started, and we do not have time to fix the system.
  Can you find the median of the data anyway?

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
  The input library is called "median"; see the sample inputs below for
  examples in your language. It defines two methods:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GetN()</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes no argument.</li>
      <li>Returns a 32-bit integer.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.1 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>GetData(i)</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes exactly one 64-bit integer argument: an index i, 0 &le; i &le;
        <code>10<sup>18</sup></code>.</li>
      <li>Returns a 32-bit integer: the number that is i places away clockwise
        from the node's fixed point, as described in the problem statement.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.1 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The data is generated as follows: values for N, a data set of N integers
  X<sub>0</sub>, X<sub>1</sub>, ..., X<sub>N-1</sub>, and
  100 "delta" integers d<sub>0</sub>, d<sub>1</sub>, ..., d<sub>99</sub> are
  chosen by the test setter. Then, a permutation P of the integers
  0 through N-1 is chosen uniformly at (pseudo)-random*; all nodes use the same
  values of N, Xs, ds and P. <br/>
  GetN() returns N in the Small dataset and -1 in the Large dataset, on all nodes.<br/>
  GetValue(i) on node j returns X<sub>P[(i + d<sub>j</sub>) % N]</sub>.<br/>
</p><p>
*: for technical reasons, the randomness used is weaker than something like
<code>std::random_shuffle</code> in C++ or <code>java.util.Collections.shuffle</code> in Java.
For transparency, this is the exact procedure used to retrieve the i-th (0-based) element out of
N of a random permutation (you do not necesarilly need to fully understand this to solve the
problem):
</p><code>
  int index = i;<br/>
  do {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; int MASK = (power == 32) ? ~0 : ((1 &lt;&lt; power) - 1);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; index += add;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; index *= m1;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; index &amp;= MASK;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; index ^= index &gt;&gt; ((power / 2) + 1);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; index += add2;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; index *= m2;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; index &amp;= MASK;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; index ^= index &gt;&gt; (2 * power / 3);<br/>
  } while (index &gt;= N);<br/>
  return index;
</code><p>
where <code>power</code> is ceil(log<sub>2</sub>(N)), and <code>add</code>, <code>add2</code>,
<code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code> are distinct constants between 0 and N - 1, inclusive,
such that <code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code> are odd.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  Output one line with a single integer: the median of the data.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
  Number of nodes: 100 <b>(for both the Small and Large datasets)</b>.<br/>
  Time limit: 7 seconds.<br/>
  Memory limit per node: 32 MB. <b>(Notice this is less than usual.)</b><br/>
  Maximum number of messages a single node can send: 5000.<br/>
  Maximum total size of messages a single node can send: 8 MB.<br/>
  1 &le; X<sub>i</sub> &le; 10<sup>9</sup>, for all i.<br/>
  N % 2 = 1. (N is odd.)<br/>
</p>

<h4>Small dataset</h4>
<p>
  d<sub>i</sub> = 0, for all i. (The nodes all indexed relative to the same
    original fixed point.)<br/>
</p>

<h4>Large dataset</h4>
<p>
  0 &le; d<sub>i</sub> &lt; N, for all i.<br/>
</p>

The sample input has access to GetN() for all cases, but contains values of d<sub>i</sub>
other than 0. To test the Small dataset, you can edit the files to have all d<sub>i</sub>
equal to 0 (the answer is of course the same). To test the Large, you can just not use
the GetN() function.
