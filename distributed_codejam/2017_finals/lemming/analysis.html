<h2>Lemming</h2>
<p>
In the problem, we are given what is effectively a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoforest#Graphs_of_functions">functional graph</a>
on a matrix: Each cell of the matrix is assigned a "next" cell, or it points to the outside.
If we define the graph's set of nodes as the cells of the matrix plus one node to
represent "outside", that points to itself, the definition fits precisely.
As you can see in the article linked above, each connected component of a functional
graph is a cycle with trees rooted at nodes in the cycle and the edges pointing in
the direction of the root.
</p><p>
The defined graph contains a single one-node cycle, which is the outside node,
as no other node points to itself.
Each other cycle is a potential trap that may leave the lemming roaming
forever unless we add a pickup point. On the other hand, setting a pickup point on any
node in a cycle is enough to "break it" and ensure that the lemming will be safe if
he starts at any point in that cycle. Moreover, this single fix also saves the lemming
when starting on a node of the connected component that is not in the cycle. Edges
point towards the root there, so following them will eventually lead the
lemming into the cycle, which we have already shown is safe after the fix.
</p><p>
However, the component with the special single-node cycle remains, which can't
be fixed in the same way because the "outside" node is not a cell, and so it
can't be turned into a pickup point. There is also a greedy strategy that works here:
for each node that points directly to the outside node, it is clear that we
need to make it a pickup point; otherwise, the lemming starting there would fall off
the matrix. Using our functional graph model of the problem, we can see that it is
also enough to fix just those cells: any other node in the matrix is part of a
tree whose edges lead to the root (the "outside"). That path has a next-to-last
node before the root, and that node is necessarilly fixed by the rule above.
</p><p>
To sum up, we need to count the number of cycles, and the number of cells that
point to the outside, and sum those two values. The result is a minimal number
of pickup points that prevent the lemming from falling off the matrix or looping around forever.
</p><p>
We can implement this count in linear time. Counting the cells that point
directly outside is simple and quick. To count cycles, we can just follow
edges starting at a cell, and keeping track of the visited nodes, both in the current
path and in the previous paths (for instance, keep an integer set at -1 for non-visited
nodes, and a path id for visited nodes, which increases for every new path).
If we encounter a node visited in the current path, we have detected
a cycle. If we go outside the matrix or encouter a node visited before, we stop
and discard the current path. Note that the first time each component is
visited, its central cycle will be discovered. Every subsequent time
we visit that component, edges on the trees will be traversed, and the search will
stop when it reaches the root, which is on the already-discovered central cycle.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, linear time is, as usual, not fast enough in Distributed Code
Jam. It's easy to distribute the task of counting the cells that point to the
outside; we can even do this in a single node. But it is more difficult to
distribute the task of counting cycles, so, from now on, we will focus on that.

<h3>Small dataset</h3>
<p>
In the Small dataset, upward moves are forbidden. This means that the only possible
cycles are of length two, with two cells that are horizontally adjacent. These can be
counted by assigning a number of rows of the matrix to each worker. As long as
each worker has an entire row, it can detect cycles within itself and the
combination of results is just the sum of all partial results.
</p>
<h3>Large dataset</h3>
<p>
For the large dataset, we need to find a way to distribute the full algorithm
to search for paths. Fortunately, the idea behind the distribution is not too
complex to describe. Unfortunately, the implementation can be a bit tricky.
</p><p>
We start by dividing the matrix evenly across machines. The easiest way is to give
each node a rectangular strip of a few rows or columns. Then, each machine can
follow the algorithm laid out at the beginning of this analysis, except that there is
a third "stop case" when following a path: moving into some other machine's
territory. When that happens, we need to record the exit point in all cells of the
path. If we reach a cell that we have already visited, it may be from an already
fixed component, in which case we do nothing futher, or it may be a cell leading
to another machine, in which case we record that in the current path as well.
In this way, we end up with some partial paths that are not in fixed components,
but rather go from one cell in the outer edge of the machine's assigned area to
another. Luckily, the size of these edges is small enough that we can send the
connectivity information over the network to a master. Using all of this information,
master can build a new graph to see how many cycles form when those partial paths
are joined, and add that count to the sum of the partial results received
from workers from components that were entirely within one worker.
