<h2>Baby Blocks: Analysis</h2>
<h3>Small dataset: a single-node solution</h3>
<p>
A single-node solution for this problem can be described, and implemented,
in a few lines. Let S<sub>i</sub> be the sum of the weights of all the blocks between indices
0 and i, inclusive, and T<sub>j</sub> be the sum of the weights of all the blocks between indices j and N-1,
inclusive, where N is the total number of blocks. Since all blocks' weights are positive,
if S<sub>i</sub> &le; T<sub>j</sub>, for all indices j' with j' &lt; j,
S<sub>i</sub> &le; T<sub>j</sub> &lt; T<sub>j'</sub>. Symmetrically, if
S<sub>i</sub> &ge; T<sub>j</sub>, for all indices i' with i' &gt; i,
S<sub>i'</sub> &gt; T<sub>j</sub>. So, we can do the following: Start with the pair
i = 0, j = N - 1. Based on the comparison, we can increase i, decrease j, or both,
and that will cover all possible pairs we need to count. Of course, when
S<sub>i</sub> = T<sub>j</sub>, we add 1 to a running total. Moreover, since the difference
between i and j decreases with every step, they will meet and the process will stop
in at most N - 1 steps. Since we examine increasingly long prefixes and suffixes, we
can also adjust S and T in constant time, and therefore, the algorithm runs in linear
time overall. This solution is fast enough for the Small dataset, but too slow for the
Large dataset, and we need to do something distributed.

<h3>Large dataset</h3>
<p>
One idea to distribute the solution is simply to assign ranges of both indices to each node,
and use the single-node solution, adding up all partial results in a master for final output.
This has two problems. The first one (and the easiest one to solve) is that we need to initialize
S<sub>i</sub> and T<sub>j</sub> as the sum of possibly many values. This can be solved
with the most common technique in Distributed Code Jam: a first stage in which each node
sums up its own ranges and distributes it to other nodes, which can sum a prefix as the sum of
many of those partial sums. The second problem is more difficult to solve: ranges of values for
i correspond to ranges of values for j in a way that depends on the value at all indices
before the first value for i and all indices after the last value for j. Fortunately, there is
also a less standard but known technique we can use to solve the synchronization. This technique
also appeared in the more involved problem
<a href="../../2016_finals/air_show/statement.html">Air Show</a>, from
the 2016 finals.

The idea is to use the first stage to get partial sums of fixed-sized intervals. Then, we can do
a version of the single-node algorithm using those partial sums as individual weights. Every time
we move one index, we get a new synchronized pair of indices, together with initial values for
S<sub>i</sub> and T<sub>j</sub>, for a worker to process. There is a bit more detail, but it is
described in
<a href="../../2016_finals/air_show/analysis.html">the analysis for
Air Show</a>. In that problem, two arrays of integers are synchronized for processing. Here, we are
synchronizing a single array and its reverse, in a way.
