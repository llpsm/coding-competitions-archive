<h3>Problem</h3>

<h2>Baby Blocks</h2>
<p>
  Your two babies Alicia and Bobby love to play with toy blocks. Their blocks
  come lined up in a single line in a box; each block has a certain weight.
  When it is time to play, Alicia takes the leftmost i blocks for some number
  i &ge; 1, and Bobby takes the j rightmost blocks for some number j &ge; 1.
  i and j are not necessarily the same, and the babies always choose values
  such that i + j does not exceed the total number of blocks. There may be
  some blocks left over in the box after the babies have finished taking
  blocks.
</p><p>
  Like many babies, Alicia and Bobby are very concerned about unfairness.
  After the babies have taken their blocks, but before the babies have started
  to play with them, Alicia will put all of her blocks on one side of a scale,
  and Bobby will put all of his blocks on the other side of the scale. If the
  two total weights are equal, the babies will play happily. Otherwise, they
  will start to cry and throw the blocks around. You would prefer to avoid this.
</p><p>
  How many possible ways are there for the babies to take blocks so that they
  will be happy? Two ways are different if and only if their (i, j) pairs are
  different.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
  The input library is called "baby_blocks"; see the sample inputs below for
  examples in your language. It defines two methods:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GetNumberOfBlocks()</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes no argument.</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number of blocks in the box.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.1 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>GetBlockWeight(i)</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes a 64-bit integer in the range 0 &le; i &lt;
        GetNumberOfBlocks().</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the weight of the i-th block in the box,
        where i = 0 corresponds to the leftmost block.</li>
    <li>Expect each call to take 0.1 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  Output a single integer: the number of different ways for the babies to take
  blocks that will make them happy.
