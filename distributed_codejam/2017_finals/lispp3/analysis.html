<h2>Lisp+++: Analysis</h2>

<p>
This Finals problem is certainly harder than Round 2 2016's
<a href="../../2016_r2/lisp_plus_plus/statement.html">Lisp++</a>.
However, it helps to consider that problem's
<a href="../../2016_r2/lisp_plus_plus/analysis.html">solution</a> as a
first step. Both problems involve parsing a simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">context-free grammar</a> by
matching opening and closing parentheses. What makes Lisp+++ a lot harder is that we also need to
match each pair of parentheses with a particular <code>+</code> most of the time.
This seemingly small change means that we can't just rely on
the count of unmatched opening parentheses as we did in Lisp++. Consider the following example:
</p><p>
  <code>((()+()+()))</code>
</p><p>
Notice that if we remove all instances of <code>()</code>, we get <code>((++))</code>, where
opening parentheses can be matched with closing ones, and either can be matched with a plus,
in the proper order. So just keeping counts of how 'deep' we are for each character won't tell
us whether the program has proper nesting.
</p>
<h3>A single-node solution</h3>
<p>
Even though a single-node solution will not pass either dataset for this problem, it is helpful to
consider one. As the example shows, just counting the frequencies of the different characters is
not enough. We can see this problem as a parentheses-matching problem with two types of opening
parentheses and closing parentheses. Openings are <code>(</code> and </code>(+</code>, and closings
are <code>+)</code> and <code>)</code>. Of course, each opening type matches exactly one closing
type, and vice versa. An important caveat is that <code>(+</code> and <code>+)</code> do not appear
consecutively, but need to have a valid program in between. However, the hard matching part involves
finding a suitable 3-match by first pairing each <code>+</code> with a <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>,
and then matching the types described above.
</p><p>
On a single machine, we can make do with a stack of openings, onto which we push any <code>(</code> or
<code>+</code> that we see. Whenever we see a <code>)</code>, we try to pop either a single <code>(</code>
or a pair <code>(+</code>. To avoid stuff like <code>++</code>, <code>(+</code>, <code>+)</code> and
<code>(())</code>, we can just remember whether the top of the stack is the last element we've seen, and
act accordingly before pushing a <code>+</code> or popping. If we are about to push a <code>+</code>, the
top needs to be a <code>(</code> and not the last character seen from the input. If we are about to pop a
pair <code>(+</code>, the top should not be the last character seen from the input. If we are about
to pop a single <code>(</code>, on the other hand, it should be the last character seen, since
<code>()</code> is valid but <code>(</code><i>P</i><code>)</code> for a program <i>P</i> is not. As soon as
we detect an error, we finish. Notice that as long as the stack is valid, there is a way to complete the
string to empty the stack without errors: just add the appropriate closing for each <code>(</code> or
<code>(+</code> in the stack, inserting extra <code>()</code> as needed. If no error is detected,
the solution can decide between outputting -1 and the length of the string by checking if the
stack is empty at the end.
</p><p>
This solution takes time linear on the input size, but that's too slow for the input bounds of
this problem. Moreover, the stack can get really large, so the memory limit is also an issue. We
need a solution that reduces both the running time and the memory requirements by distributing
the work.
</p>
<h3>Small dataset</h3>
<p>
There are two similar solutions to the Small dataset. Both depend on dividing the work evenly
between nodes and combining the results in a master,
taking advantage of the extra limit on the number of <code>+</code> characters in the input.
When distributing the strategy mentioned above, the algorithm gets only a bit more complicated
than the single-node algorithm.
Each node gets a substring S from the input. For any node except the one getting the
leftmost piece, there could be pluses and closing parentheses on it that need to be matched with
pluses and/or opening parentheses that are outside of S. To represent them, we introduce a
second stack that we call the left stack. The original stack in the single-node solution is,
accordingly, the right stack. We work as in the single-node algorithm, except that if the
right stack is empty, and we see a <code>+</code> or a <code>)</code>, we push it onto the left
stack. This means that is pending matching with characters to the left of S. Opening parentheses
are always pushed to the right stack. If there is something in the right stack, any match must use
it before something can be pending on the left stack. Once a node is finished parsing its substring,
it will have left and right stacks (either could be empty), and it may have found an error.
</p><p>
We can then take advantage of the extra Small limit on <code>+</code>es to "compress" these stacks
to send them all to a single master. Since stacks contain a single type of parenthesis and up to
100 pluses, we can represent them as a list of up to 101 integers by counting the size of each
block of consecutive parentheses together. Then, the master can simulate matching large consecutive
pieces, instead of matching individual parentheses.
</p><p>
A more insightful solution with a simpler implementation is to observe the effect of the <code>+</code>
limit on the single-node solution. Any popping from the stack that is not immediately after a push
requires a <code>+</code> to not be an error. This implies that at most the top 101 opening parentheses
can be successfully matched and popped. A stack can also contain up to 100 pluses. This makes only
the top 201 characters relevant, but it's also important to distinguish a stack with 201 characters
from one with 202 or more, due to the need to recognize the empty stack at the end. This means
only the top 202 elements in the stack are really impactful on the final answer and we can
discard the rest.
</p><p>
In the distributed solution we started above,
instead of compressing, we can just ship the topmost 202 elements of the right stacks (or all if
less than that) to the master. Similarly, at most the bottom-most 202 elements of a left stack can
produce a successful match and pop when combining, so we can ship only those. This requires the
master to receive and process up to 404 &times; 99 characters, which it can do using the regular
algorithm instead of trying to speed through compressed stacks. Notice that for left stacks, you
need to either reconstruct the stack or ship input indices instead of characters to be able to know the
error place once the error is detected. Right stacks, on the other hand, can be sent as characters,
as all errors when processing the right stacks are checked in the workers, not in the master.
</p><p>
After combining the received left and right stacks, the master outputs the earliest error among
the internal errors reported by workers and its own discoveries while combining.
</p><p>
The first stage of this algorithm takes time O(N / M), where N is the length of the input and M is
the number of machines, as building the stacks requires a single pass over the assigned substring,
with each character requiring only constant time to process (it only depends on the tops of the
stacks). The combine stage is linear on the size of the things received by the master, which makes
it negligible, so the overall time complexity is O(N / M).
</p>
<h3>Large dataset</h3>
<p>
For the Large dataset we use the same initial approach of building a left and right stack on each
node for a substring of the input. Unfortunately, we can't afford to send them all to a master,
since matching elements can be arbitrarily far apart, spanning multiple nodes. Moreover, the stacks are
not highly compressible &mdash; quite the opposite! Since each parentheses type <code>(</code> or
<code>(+</code> on a right stack matches a particular type <code>+)</code> or <code>)</code> on a left
stack, and they can be arbitrarily interleaved, stacks have an information density higher than 1 bit
per 2 characters. We are not allowed enough communication size to send that amount, even with great
compression.
</p><p>
Before continuing, please be advised that we will skip even more details than in the solutions
presented before. There are many details to take into account, mostly due to
translating the "is the top of the stack the last element pushed" of the single-node algorithm
into a distributed solution. As an illustration, the first official solution we wrote for this
problem had 35 ifs and 8 fors, which makes for 43 comparisons, all of which have to be just right.
</p><p>
We will let L<sub>i</sub> and R<sub>i</sub> represent the left and right stacks from node i,
assuming that nodes with smaller indices are assigned substrings closer to the beginning of the
string. Then, the stacks are logically arranged in the following way:
</p><p>
L<sub>0</sub> R<sub>0</sub> L<sub>1</sub> R<sub>1</sub> L<sub>2</sub> R<sub>2</sub> ...
</p><p>
From this, we can see that L<sub>0</sub> should be empty, or otherwise it will necessarily
cause an error. Also, the right part of R<sub>i</sub> must match the left part of L<sub>i+1</sub>.
Moreover, at least one of them (the one with the fewest parentheses) is matched completely in that
pairing. This hints at a possible solution: a master gathers data about the number of
parentheses on each stack, and processes them in the order shown above. The master builds a
stack of pending right stacks. Each right stack is added to it. Each left stack is matched to the
top right stack. That empties at least one of them. If the right stack empties, it is removed from
the stack of right stacks. If the left stack is not exhausted, it is matched with the new top,
and so on, until either the left stack is exhausted or the stack of right stacks is empty. If there
is left stack after emptying the right stacks, there is an error in there and we need to match
no further. Otherwise, we continue with the right stacks that remain.
</p><p>
During this algorithm, the master needs to keep track of sub-stacks as stacks are sometimes
partially matched after a pairing, and also to explain the pairing to worker nodes.
Each sub-stack is an interval of parentheses within a stack, with all the associated pluses. We
can represent stacks by an interval of positions. Reprocessing those positions with the original
algorithm will yield the same stack. We can represent a sub-stack as an interval of <i>remaining</i>
parentheses within a stack. Parentheses that are fully matched within a worker node are counted, as
they do not appear in the stacks the master considers. Since each pairing exhausts at least one stack,
and there are 2M stacks, there are at most 2M pairings. This means we can assign each worker at most 2
pairings and they will all be processed. Processing a pairing requires reading at most 2 N / M
characters, for a total of 4 N / M, because a stack contains at most N / M characters. Depending on
the strategy to assign pairs to workers, it's possible to get the number of characters a worker needs
to process in the worst case down to 2 N / M overall.
</p><p>
Then, each worker reports up to 3 errors to the master:
one initial internal error from the first stage, and up to two errors from the pairings. The master
gathers all those errors and reports the earliest, or uses the same strategy of checking whether
the stack of right stacks is empty to decide between -1 and the length of the input.
</p><p>
As a quick overview of where all those technicalities arise, notice that stacks or sub-stacks may
eventually consist of a single <code>+</code>, which can't really be matched directly and must wait to
be attached in between another pair. When that happens, we need to carry the index to avoid an extra
full reconstruction just for that character. Additionally, one needs to keep track of whether the
top of the right stack or sub-stack is the last character in the input while matching a pair.
