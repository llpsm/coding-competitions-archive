  Our fourth Distributed Code Jam contest continued to push the boundaries of
  the format. <i>Klingon Quiz</i> challenged contestants to answer
  multiple-choice questions that they could not actually see. <i>Dodge</i>
  presented a somewhat chaotic situation, with waves of monsters swarming
  through a grid, but it could be solved via distributed dynamic programming.
  <i>Virus</i> represented a new extreme in problems about the DCJ system being
  broken &mdash; nodes could become infected in a way that rendered them
  useless to contestants, and even the act of investigating the problem was
  bound to spread the infection! Finally, <i>Khazad-d&ucirc;m</i> was DCJ's
  first floating-point problem; it entailed helping dwarves build a road,
  subject to some difficult constraints.

  It takes a while just to read and think through problems of this level, and
  the scoreboard was quiet for the first 45 minutes or so. Most contestants
  started with the Small dataset of Virus. By the 2 hour and 30 minute mark,
  all four problems had Large submissions, so the race was on! For the
  remainder of the round, contestants struggled to break the 61 point
  barrier (Dodge + Virus-Small + Khazaddum), with several reaching that total,
  and a very late submission from <b>EgorKulikov</b> brought him to 80
  points... but would those scores hold up?
</p><p>
  When the judgments had finished, it was <b>Radewoosh</b> on top with 61,
  followed by <b>kevinsogo</b> with a literally last-minute Khazaddum
  submission that also vaulted him to 61. <b>tczajka</b> was third with 53.
  In a first for the DCJ finals, every problem was completely solved by at
  least one contestant, although the more unusual problems got fewer submissions.
  Kudos to <b>fagu</b> and <b>Errichto.rekt</b> for being the only solvers of
  Klingon and Virus, respectively. You can check out individual contestants'
