<h3>Problem</h3>

<h2>Dodge!</h2>
<p>
  You are playing the arcade game &quot;Dodge!&quot;, and you are really
  motivated to get onto the scoreboard. Unfortunately, the machine you are
  playing on is old and partially broken, and not all of the buttons work, so
  you will have to work even harder.
</p><p>
  In Dodge!, you control a character who is trying to navigate from one
  <i>starting cell</i> of an infinite grid &mdash; (0, 0) &mdash; to another
  <i>target cell</i> &mdash; (<b>N</b>-1, <b>N</b>-1). The down and left
  buttons are broken, so you can move your character only up and/or to the
  right. Moreover, you have to watch out for monsters! Normally, you would be
  able to fight the monsters, but the attack button is also broken, so you can
  only try to avoid them, and take damage when you do not.
</p><p>
  Monsters in the game are generated ("spawned") by monster generators; a
  spawned monster appears in the same cell as the generator. There is one
  generator in each column between your starting column and the column
  containing the target cell, inclusive; these are all located somewhere above
  the row containing the target cell. Specifically, each can be located
  in a row between <b>N</b> and <b>N</b> + <b>F</b> - 1, inclusive, where
  <b>F</b> is a positive integer. (These generators are not necessarily all
  in the same row.) Monsters spawned by these generators always move
  downward. (We will say more about <b>F</b> and monster movement in a moment).
</p><p>
  Similarly, there is one generator in each row between your starting row and
  the row containing the target cell, inclusive; these are all located
  somewhere to the right of the column containing the target cell. Specifically,
  each can be located in a column between <b>N</b> and <b>N</b> + <b>F</b> - 1.
  (These generators are not necessarily all in the same column.) Monsters
  spawned by these generators always move to the left.
</p><p>
  The game proceeds in discrete units of time called <i>turns</i>, numbered with
  integers. In each turn, the following things happen, in order:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>If it is turn 0, you appear in the starting cell.</li>
  <li>You must move your character one grid cell up or to the right. You cannot
    remain in your current cell.</li>
  <li>Every monster moves either down or to the left, depending on which
    generator spawned it, as described above.</li>
  <li>You take one point of damage for every monster in the cell you are
    currently in.</li>
  <li>If there are two monsters in a single cell, they fight and annihilate
    each other, and both disappear from the grid forever.</li>
  <li>If the turn number is divisible by <b>F</b>, each of the generators spawns a
    new monster. The newly spawned monster is in the same cell as the
    generator.</li>
  <li>If you are in the target cell, the game ends.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the next turn (numbered one larger than the last turn) starts.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Note that moving into a cell with a monster in step 2 does not cause you to
  take damage; the monster is preparing to move out shortly in step 3, and so
  you can dodge!
</p><p>
  Moreover, to make things more challenging, before the player appears in the
  starting cell, the game has already been running since at least turn
  <b>-10FN</b>, so there are already monsters on the grid when you enter; note that
  some of those monsters might have already encountered and annihilated each
  other.
</p><p>
  If you move optimally, what is the minimum amount of damage you will take
  before the game ends?
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
  The input library is called "dodge"; see the sample inputs below for
  examples in your language. It defines four methods:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GetN()</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes no argument.</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number <b>N</b>, as described
        above.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.1 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>GetSpawningFrequency()</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes no argument.</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number <b>F</b>, as described
        above.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.1 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>RowGeneratorPosition(row)</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes one 64-bit integer, row - the index of the row, in the range 0
          &le; row &lt; GetN().</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the position of the generator in that row.
          This means there is a generator spawning monsters that move to the left
          in cell (RowGeneratorPosition(row), row).</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.1 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>ColumnGeneratorPosition(column)</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes one 64-bit integer, column - the index of the column, in the
          range 0 &le; column &lt; GetN().</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the position of the generator in that column.
          This means there is a generator spawning monsters that move down in
          cell (column, ColumnGeneratorPosition(column)).</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.1 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
