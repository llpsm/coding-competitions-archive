  The online round of our fourth Distributed Code Jam tournament presented
  four more parallelization challenges. <i>Stones</i> and <i>Towels</i> were
  the "easier" two of the four, but it was not trivial to find good distribution
  mechanisms and get the details right. <i>Kenneth</i> presented a new twist on
  our theme (introduced in 2017) of nodes behaving differently &mdash; in this
  case, different nodes had different parts of the input data. Finally,
  <i>One More Time</i> revived a problem type
  <a href="../2016_r1/oops/statement.html" target="_blank">from</a>
  <a href="../2016_r2/again/statement.html" target="_blank">2016</a>
  in which contestants had to understand a piece of hopelessly slow code and
  rewrite it to be more efficient.

  Distributed Code Jam, which is never exactly known for being easy, was harder
  than usual in this round. Even for our top competitors, it was a challenge to
  fully solve even two of the problems. The last problem was tough enough that
  we only got our first correct Small submission around two and a half hours
  into the contest. The number of submissions heated up quite a bit in the last
  half hour of the contest, and the large number of 100-node Small datasets
  meant that the judging system fell behind; we apologize to those of you who
  experienced delays.

  Twenty seconds before the end of the round, <b>Errichto.rekt</b> successfully
  solved <i>One More Time</i>, jumping into first place and thereby becoming
  the first contestant ever to sweep both the Code Jam and Distributed Code Jam
  semifinal rounds. <b>mareksom</b> and <b>apiapiapiad</b> were second and
  third with fast 64-point performances (all three of the first problems).
  The tentative cutoff is at 51 points; our defending Distributed Code Jam
  champion <b>ecnerwala</b> made this cutoff. We also want to extend a special
  shout-out to <b>Xhark</b> for being the only other contestant besides
  <b>Errichto.rekt</b> to solve the hardest problem.

  This wraps up the online rounds of the Code Jam 2018 tournament! We will see
  our Code Jam and Distributed Code Jam advancers in Toronto in two months for
  the World Finals. Thanks to everyone who participated in DCJ!
