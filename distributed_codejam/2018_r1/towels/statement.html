<h3>Problem</h3>

<h2>Towels</h2>
<p>
  At the start of each day, your local gym puts out <b>P</b> stacks of towels.
  Each stack has <b>K</b> towels in it. Towels are of differing cleanliness -
  each towel has a unique <i>cleanliness rank</i> assigned, which is an integer
  from 1 to <b>P</b> &times; <b>K</b>, with 1 being the cleanest.
</p><p>
  A total of <b>P</b> &times; <b>K</b> people use the gym each day, and they
  arrive one at a time. Each person looks at the towels on top of all the
  non-empty stacks, and then takes the cleanest one of those towels.
</p>
<p>
  As a longtime user of this gym who pays a lot of attention to towel hygiene,
  you know the cleanliness rank of every towel in every pile. You are planning
  to visit the gym today, and you know exactly how many people will pick a
  towel before you do. When you arrive at the gym, you will pick the cleanest
  towel among the top towels in non-empty stacks, in the same way that other
  gym users do. What is the cleanliness rank of the towel you will get?
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
  The input library is called "towels"; see the sample inputs below for
  examples in your language. It defines four methods:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GetNumberOfStacks()</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes no argument.</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number of stacks of towels.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.05 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>GetNumberOfTowelsInStack()</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes no argument.</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number of towels in each stack.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.05 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>GetNumberOfGymUsersBeforeYou()</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes no argument.</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number of gym users who pick a towel
        before you do.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.05 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>GetTowelCleanlinessRank(stack, position)</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes two 64-bit integers, stack (the index of the stack) and position
        (the position of the towel in the stack, counting from the bottom), in
        the ranges
        0 &le; stack &lt; GetNumberOfStacks() and
        0 &le; position &lt; GetNumberOfTowelsInStack().</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the cleanliness rank of the towel.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.05 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  Output a single integer: the cleanliness rank of the towel you will pick.
