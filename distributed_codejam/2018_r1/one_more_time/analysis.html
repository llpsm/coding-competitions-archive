<h2>One More Time: Analysis</h2>
<p>
  This problem has two parts: figuring out what the code does, and doing it better.
</p>
<h3>What is the problem?</h3>
<p>
  The most important realization is that the value of <code>calculate(index)</code> does not
  depend on the node in which the call is made. This is because the only part of
  the body of <code>calculate</code> that is node-dependent is the first 3 lines;
  those lines call <code>get_number</code>, which in turn "questions" some other node
  for index, which is answered by returning <code>calculate(index)</code>, too. So, this
  part either hangs forever or ends up returning the result of the last 4 lines of
  the given code back to the original questioner.
</p><p>
  To see that it doesn't hang forever, notice that replacing
  <code>MyNodeId()</code> inside the condition in the first line of
  <code>calculate(index)</code> with the definition of
  <code>responsible_node</code> calculated in <code>get_number</code>
  gives us
  <code>index &lt; 1 + ((index - 1) * NumberOfNodes() / GetN()) * GetN() / NumberOfNodes()</code>
  which is always false. Because the division is truncated, we can't just simplify to
  <code>index &lt; index</code>. However,
  <code>((index - 1) * NumberOfNodes() / GetN()) * GetN()</code>
  is just <code>((index - 1) * NumberOfNodes() - (((index - 1) * NumberOfNodes()) % GetN())</code>.
  Dividing by <code>NumberOfNodes()</code> we obtain
  <code>(index - 1) - ((((index - 1) * NumberOfNodes()) % GetN()) / NumberOfNodes())</code> and
  <code>index - 1 &lt; GetN()</code>, which makes the subtrahend equal to 0.
  A faster way to arrive to the same conclusion is to notice that the statement assumes the given
  code is correct for the given inputs, so it must terminate.
</p><p>
  This leaves us with the problem of calculating F(<code>GetN()</code>), where
  F is defined by F(i) = F(i-1) + <code>GetM()</code> * F(i-2) + F(i/3) + <code>GetA</code>(n)
  with F(0) = F(1) = F(2) = 1. For the Small dataset, since <code>GetM()</code> = 0, this
  reduces to F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i/3) + <code>GetA</code>(n).
</p>
<h3>A faster approach</h3>
<p>
  Non-distributedly, we can calculate this in O(<code>GetN()</code>) with a simple
  dynamic programming algorithm that keeps an array of values we know for F, and calculates
  them in increasing order. To distribute this, we have to think further.
</p><p>
  We can take advantage of the fact that to calculate F over a range of values
  [A, B], we only need to know F(A-1), F(A-2) and F over the range [A/3, B/3].
  We can make a particular node responsible for the ranges [3<sup>i</sup>A, 3<sup>i</sup>B]
  for each i, which leaves us only the values F(3<sup>i</sup>A-1) and F(3<sup>i</sup>A-2))
  to require externally. To simplify the notation, assume we start by computing F in the
  range [0, X] for a sufficiently large X in every node, using the single-node version
  above, so that they all have a basis to start that doesn't require information from other
  nodes.
</p><p>
  Then, we can proceed in stages. In stage i, a node computes F on all values in the
  range [3<sup>i</sup>A, 3<sup>i</sup>B], using the values computed in the previous stage,
  and the values F(3<sup>i</sup>A-1) and F(3<sup>i</sup>A-2)) it receives via message from another
  node, if they are not in the [0, X] range. The problem is that this is a serial algorithm.
  The only node that can proceed is the one starting with a range [X + 1, B], which can then pass
  some values to some other node that can now calculate [B + 1, C], etc, but all nodes except
  one are waiting on some other node for its two extra values! This distribution strategy does
  not gain us anything.
</p><p>
  To do better, let us split the Small and Large datasets. For the Small dataset,
  each node only requires one pending value F(3<sup>i</sup>A-1).
  The sequence for the Small dataset is linear on the
  pending values. That is, if F(3<sup>i</sup>A-1) decreases by 1, then so do F(3<sup>i</sup>A),
  F(3<sup>i</sup>A+1), etc.
  So, during stage i, every node can calculate its range assuming the extra
  value it doesn't know is 0, and then, when that value arrives from another node,
  add it to every calculated value.
</p><p>
  For the Large dataset, the sequence behaves like a modified Fibonacci
  sequence. That is, if F(3<sup>i</sup>A-1) decreases by 1,
  then F(3<sup>i</sup>A) decreases by 1, F(3<sup>i</sup>A+1) decreases by 1 + M,
  F(3<sup>i</sup>A+2) decreases by 2M + 1,
  F(3<sup>i</sup>A+3) decreases by M<sup>2</sup> + 3M + 1, and in general
  F(3<sup>i</sup>A+k) decreases by Fib(k+1), where Fib(k) is the k-th term in the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci sequence</a>
  Similarly, if we decrease F(3<sup>i</sup>A-2) by 1, F(3<sup>i</sup>A+k) decreases
  by <code>GetM()</code> &times; Fib(k). As for the Small dataset, each node can
  calculate the values in its range for stage i assuming the two pending values are
  zero, and then apply the actual values when they arrive using the formula above.
  Doing this efficiently requires pre-computing the Fibonacci sequence on each node,
  but we only need few terms: if the maximum range of any stage is of size K, we need
  at most K+2 terms of the sequence. We can do this at the beginning of the process
  with minimal impact on the overall running time.
</p><p>
  A comment on the value of X above: while the minimum possible value for it is rather small,
  in practice it's better to set it to a high value like 10<sup>7</sup> to save the first
  few stages in which the ranges calculated by each node are small and the running time
  is dominated by the latency of passing around messages.
