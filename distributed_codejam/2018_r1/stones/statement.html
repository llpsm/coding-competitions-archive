<h3>Problem</h3>

<h2>Stones</h2>
<p>
  You are standing on one side of a very broad river, and the love of your life is on the other
  side. There is no reason to think for too long -- you will need to jump across!
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately, the river contains a single line of stepping stones that you can jump on. Because the
  stones are not necessarily all equally easy to stand on, the distance that you can jump
  can differ from stone to stone! For each stone, you know the farthest stone you can jump to
  from it. (You can jump to that stone, or any other stone between it and your current stone.)
  So, maybe there is some need to think about this - you want to make as few jumps as possible,
  since every jump carries a risk that you will trip, fall into the water, and embarrass yourself
  while the love of your life is watching.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
  The input library is called "stones"; see the sample inputs below for
  examples in your language. It defines two methods:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GetNumberOfStones()</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes no argument.</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number of stones in the river.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.05 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>GetJumpLength(location)</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes a 64-bit integer: the index (1-based) of the stone you are considering jumping
          from, or 0 (to denote jumping from the shore you are beginning on).</li>
      <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the maximum distance (in stones) that you can jump forward from
        this one. If you can land on the opposite shore, the returned number will be
        larger than the number of stones in front of you.</li>
      <li>Expect each call to take 0.05 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  Output a single integer: the minimum number of jumps you need to make to cross the river.
