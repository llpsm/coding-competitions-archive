<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>
In writing multi-threaded programs one of the big problems is to prevent
concurrent access to data. One of the more common mechanisms for doing this is
using <i>mutual exclusion locks</i> (also called <i>mutexes</i>). A <i>mutex</i>
is something that can be acquired by only one thread at a time. If one thread
has already acquired the mutex, and a second thread tries to acquire it, the
second thread will wait until the first thread releases the mutex, and only then
will it proceed (with acquiring the mutex and doing whatever it planned on
doing next).
</p>

<p>
A danger when using mutexes is <i>deadlock</i> &mdash; a situation where some
threads block each other and will never proceed. A deadlock occurs when each one
thread has already acquired mutex <b>A</b>, and now tries to acquire mutex
<b>B</b>, while another thread has already acquired mutex <b>B</b> and tries to
acquire mutex <b>A</b> (more complex scenarios with more threads are also
possible, but we will only be concerned with the two-thread situation).
</p>

<p>
You are now analyzing a two-threaded program, and trying to determine whether it
will deadlock. You know the exact set of mutex operations (acquire and release)
each of the two threads will perform, in order. However, you do not know how
quickly each thread will perform each of its operations &mdash; it is possible,
for instance, for one thread to perform almost all of its operations, then for
the other thread to catch up, and then for the first thread to proceed.
</p>

<p>
You are interested in determining whether it is possible that the two threads
will deadlock. Initially all the mutexes are released. We assume that when a
thread has finished all of its operations, it releases all the mutexes it
still has acquired.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library will be called &quot;mutexes&quot;; see the sample inputs
below for examples in your language. It will define two methods:
NumberOfOperations(i), which will return the number of operations thread
<i>i</i> performs (<i>i</i> has to be 0 or 1), and GetOperation(i, index),
which will report what the <i>index</i>th operation performed by thread <i>i</i>
is (where <i>i</i> is 0 or 1, and
0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>index</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;NumberOfOperations(i)). This will
be a positive number <i>X</i> if the <i>index</i>th operation is to acquire
mutex <i>X</i>, and a negative number <i>-X</i> if the <i>index</i>th
operation is to release mutex <i>X</i>.<br/>
The sequence of operations for a single thread will always be valid, that is,
a given thread will never try to acquire a lock it has already acquired (and not
yet released), or release a lock it has already released (and not yet acquired)
or has never acquired in the first place. A thread's first operation on a lock
(if any) will always be an acquire operation.<br/>
One call to GetOperation will take approximately 0.005 microseconds, with the
exception of the first call, which will cache the input values and might take
up to 100 milliseconds.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output the smallest total number of operations the two threads can perform
before deadlocking (including the last two acquire operations), if a deadlock
is possible, or the word <code>OK</code> if a deadlock can't happen.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
Each node will have access to 256MB of RAM, and a time limit of 4 seconds.<br/>
-10<sup>5</sup> &le; GetOperation(i, index) &le; 10<sup>5</sup> for all valid
<i>i</i> and <i>index</i>. GetOperation will never return 0.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Small input</h4>
<p>
Your solution will run on 10 nodes.<br/>
1 &le; NumberOfOperations(i) &le; 1000 for both possible values of <i>i</i>.
<br/>
</p>

<h4>Large input</h4>
<p>
Your solution will run on 100 nodes.<br/>
1 &le; NumberOfOperations(i) &le; 4 &times;10<sup>4</sup> for both possible
values of <i>i</i>.
<br/>
</p>

<p>
The fastest way to deadlock in the third example is for the first thread to
perform the first three operations (ending up with mutexes 1, 2 and 3), then
for the first thread to perform the first operation (acquiring mutex 4). At
this point both threads try to perform one operation more (the first thread
trying to acquire mutex 4, the second thread trying to acquire mutex 3) and
deadlock.
