<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>
You were born and live in a small town in a remote mountain range extending
east to west. In this mountain range there is a peak every kilometer, and there
are no intermediate peaks. Recently, you checked on the Internet what the
highest peak in the range is, and were suprised &mdash; from your town a
different peak seems to be the highest. And when you went for a walk to the
nearest mountain top, yet another peak appeared to be highest. You're not sure
the Internet data is correct (they write all sorts of stuff on the Internet!),
so you decided to compile your own list of potentially highest peaks in the
range.

<p>
Your list will contain every peak <b>B</b> with the following property:
if <b>B</b> is visible from some other peak <b>A</b>, no peak beyond <b>B</b>
is visible from <b>A</b>.
Formally, this means that if <b>B</b> lies, say, to the east of <b>A</b>,
then all peaks between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are below the line connecting
<b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, and all the peaks to the east of <b>B</b> are below or
on that line.
</p>

<p>
In this example, the fourth peak is the last one you see to the east from
the first and third peaks. From the second peak, to the east you only see the
third peak. Your list will include only peaks 1 and 4: peak 2 is visible
from peak 3, but is not the farthest (1 is), and peak 3 is visible from
peak 1, but is not the farthest (4 is).
</p>

<p>
The rationale for this criterion is that you figure that if from some peak
<b>A</b> you can see peak <b>C</b>, and you can also see some other peak
<b>D</b> that lies in the same direction and is more distant, then <b>C</b> is
obviously not the highest peak in the range (because either <b>A</b>, or
<b>D</b>, is higher). You don't trust your intuition any more, so even if the
highest visible peak in
any direction appears to be much lower than the one you're standing on (for
instance, you are standing on a peak of height 1000, and the next and last peak
to the east is of height 1), you will consider the peak of height 1 to be a
candidate for your list.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library will be called &quot;highest_mountain&quot;; see the sample
inputs below for examples in your language. It will define two methods:
NumberOfPeaks(),
which will return the number of peaks in the range, and GetHeight(i),
which will return the height of the <i>i</i>th peak from the west, for
0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;NumberOfPeaks().<br/>
One call to GetHeight will take approximately 0.1 microseconds.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output one number: the total number of the peaks that will be included in your
list.
<br/>
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
Each node will have access to 128MB of RAM, and a time limit of 6 seconds.<br/>
0 &le; GetHeight(i) &le; 10<sup>9</sup> for all i with 0 &le; i &lt; NumberOfPeaks().<br/>
</p>

<h4>Small input</h4>
<p>
Your solution will run on 10 nodes.<br/>
1 &le; NumberOfPeaks() &le; 1000.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Large input</h4>
<p>
Your solution will run on 100 nodes.<br/>
1 &le; NumberOfPeaks() &le; 4 &quot; 10<sup>8</sup>.<br/>
