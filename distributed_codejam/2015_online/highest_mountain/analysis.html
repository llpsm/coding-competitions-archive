<p>
The first part of the problem is to understand what will the list we're asked about actually contain. It turns out it is the "upper convex hull" - that is, the set of points that would be in the convex hull if we added one extra point with height of minus infinity.
</p>

<p>
The description of the list says that we exclude any peak A such that there exists a line connecting two peaks B and C, one to each side of A, going above A, and A is visible from B. If such a line exists, then - indeed - we know A is not the highest peak (because we can see it from B, but we also see C as higher).<br/>
One of the definitions of an upper convex hull is that we exclude any peak A such that there exists a line connecting two peaks B and C, one to each side of A, going above A (without the extra visibility condition). So, if we exclude a peak from our list we obviously exclude it from the convex hull as well. We have to understand why a peak excluded from the convex hull will also be excluded from our list.
</p>

<p>
To see this, consider some peak A that is excluded from the convex hull. Out of all the possible lines BC that would cause it to be excluded from the convex hull, take the one in which B is as close to A as possible (horizontally). Then, we claim A is visible from B. If it weren't, there would be some other peak D between A and B, lying above the line AB - but then the line DC would also lie above A, and - as D is closer horizontally to A than B - contradicting our choice of B. Thus, every peak excluded from the convex hull is also excluded from our list - so our list simply is the upper convex hull.
</p>

<p>
The problem is far from over at this point, however. While calculating the upper convex hull of a set of points is a standard problem on one machine (solvable in O(N), if the points are given sorted by the x-coordinate, as they are in this problem), we need to parallelize this, as the input is too large to read in on one machine.
</p>

<p>
Let's begin by splitting the input evenly between nodes, each node getting a range of consecutive points, and calculating the upper convex hull of these points. One tempting option is to try shipping all these convex hulls to one node and have it merge them all. Unfortunately, this doesn't work - the convex hull calculated on each node can have over 2 million points (even after some compressions), and sending nearly 800MB of data to one node will not be fast enough.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, when we have two upper convex hulls on separate ranges of points, merging them can be done much faster (and using much less data) than in linear time. To merge two upper convex hulls, we need to find a common tangent line to both; which can be done through a nested ternary search. For a point on one of the hulls, we can find the line through this point and tangent to the other hull by a ternary search on the other hull. And now we can ternary-search on the first hull for the point in which this tangent line to the second hull will be tangent to the first hull as well.
</p>

<p>
A naive implementation of this nested ternary search between two nodes would send a lot of messages back and forth (a single ternary search sends queries for around 80 points - with 5ms for a single turnaround this would mean around 0.4s for merging two nodes). To speed this up, we can "prefetch" the points to query. Instead of sending two points as a single ternary-search step, we can send, say, 1000 points, and have the addressee do the ternary search locally. This way, in two or three message exchanges we will merge two convex hulls.
</p>

<p>
Now we can merge the convex hulls one by one. We also need to accommodate the possibility that one of the convex hulls will fully disappear from the result. In this case, we need to forget about it, and merge the previous one with the other convex hull from the pair.
</p>

<p>
Calculating the convex hull in a given node is dominated by reading the input, which will take roughly 0.4 seconds. Merging two convex hulls requires sending at most three messages back and forth, taking around 20ms, which gives a total runtime of below 3s for obtaining the whole answer.
