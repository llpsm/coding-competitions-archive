<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>
You and Johnny play a very simple card game. Both players have a deck of cards.
Both draw a card at random from their deck, and the player with the better card
wins. &quot;Better&quot; is a complex concept, but for any two cards, you (and
Johnny) know which one is better, with no ties allowed. Note that this is not
necessarily transitive: if card A is better than B, and B is better than C, it
is possible that C is better than A.
</p>
<p>
Johnny is very, very unhappy when he loses. So, you would like to make sure that
he will win. You have <i>N</i> cards, and you want to split them into two
non-empty decks (with no cards left over), one for you and one for Johnny,
so that whatever card you draw from your deck and whatever card Johnny draws
from his, Johnny will win.
</p>
<p>
If it is possible to do this in multiple ways, you want Johnny's
deck to be as large as possible (as long as your deck is not empty).
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library will be called &quot;johnny&quot;; see the sample inputs
below for examples in your language. It will define two methods: NumberOfCards(), which
will return the number of cards, and IsBetter(i, j), which will return true
if card <i>i</i> is better than card <i>j</i>, for 0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>i</i>,
<i>j</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;NumberOfCards().
If called with <i>i</i>=<i>j</i>, it will return false.
One call to IsBetter will take approximately 0.025 microseconds.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
If it is possible to split the cards so that Johnny will always win, output one
number: the largest possible size of Johnny's deck. If it is impossible to split
the cards in such a way, output the word <code>IMPOSSIBLE</code>.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
Each node will have access to 256MB of RAM, and a time limit of 3 seconds.<br/>
</p>
