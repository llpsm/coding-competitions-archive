The problems on the first Distributed Code Jam online round proved much tougher than we initially expected; in particular no-one managed to successfully tackle the tricky Highest Mountain problem. Solving Almost Sorted and Let Johnny Win with a good time and with some extra points from the smalls was enough to qualify for the finals.

<p>
<i>Almost Sorted</i> was a warmup problem, as far as any of the problems in the round can be named easy. Over a hundred correct solutions for the large were submitted.
<i>Mutexes</i> was a two-dimensional DP, with the extra lesson that two-dimensional DPs can be parallelized effectively.
<i>Let Johnny Win</i> was a graph problem, where the crucial realization was that the degrees of the nodes tell almost the whole story.
<i>Highest Mountain</i> required figuring out how to parallelize the convex hull algorithm effectively - a surprisingly complicated task!

Cast

The cast will be somewhat more robust than usually, as a lot of people were involved in making Distributed Code Jam a reality. In no particular order, the team was:
<ul>
<li><i>Onufry Wojtaszczyk</i> was the lead of the project, responsible for the initial idea and overseeing the implementation; and also responsible for the problemset.</li>
<li><i>Andi Purice</i> improved the stability of the platform to the point where we could run the contest and integrated Distributed Code Jam with the Code Jam frontend.</li>
<li><i>Maciek Klimek</i> wrote the initial version of the whole platform, and proved the concept is possible to execute.</li>
<li><i>Jarek Przybyłowicz</i> designed a lot of the stability improvements, designed and implemented the monitoring, and made improvements to our frontend.</li>
<li><i>Bartek Janiak</i> was the initiator of multi-language support, and oversaw Andi's work on the platform stability.</li>
<li><i>Joachim Bartosik</i> wrote the local testing tool and the glue code between the frontend and the backend.</li>
<li><i>Neo Liu</i> implemented support for Java.</li>
<li><i>Emily Miller</i> managed the budget, organized us and provided constant support.</li>
</ul>

A lot of people supported us throughout the almost two years from idea to launch:
Christina Hill,
David Spies,
Dina Garmash,
Dominika Rogozińska,
Elizabeth Sapiro,
Hackson Leung,
Igor Naverniouk,
Jarek Kuśmierek,
John Dethridge,
John Wilkes,
Kacper Nowicki,
Marcin Bilkowski,
Marcin Gawlik,
Piotr Witusowski,
Prasanjit Barua,
Tomek Błaszczyk,
 and many many others.
