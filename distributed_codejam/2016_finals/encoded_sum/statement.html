<h3>Problem</h3>

<h2>Encoded Sum</h2>

<p>
You are an archaeologist studying a lost civilization. This civilization used
a decimal (base 10) number system like our own: their numbers were made up of
digits from 0 through 9, with the most significant digit on the left. However,
this civilization used the ten letters A through J, in some order, to represent
the ten digits 0 through 9, in a one-to-one mapping.
</p>

<p>
You have just discovered two scrolls from that civilization. Each contains a
number representing the population of one of the two regions of the
civilization. The numbers are of the same length. You do not know the
civilization's letter-to-digit mapping, but you know it is consistent across
the two documents. You want to know the maximal possible sum of those two
numbers. Please note that the resulting numbers can have leading zeros.
</p>

<p>
Given these two scrolls, return the maximal possible sum. Since the output can
be a really big number, we only ask you to output the remainder of dividing
the result by the prime 10<sup>9</sup>+7 (1000000007).
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library is called "encoded_sum"; see the sample inputs below for
examples in your language. It defines three methods:

<ul>

<li><b>GetLength()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the length of the number on either scroll.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.08 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetScrollOne(i)</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes a 64-bit number in the range 0 &le; i &lt; GetLength()</li>
  <li>Returns an uppercase character (in the inclusive range <code>A</code>
    through <code>J</code>) representing the i-th character in the first
    scroll, counting starting from 0, starting from the left.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.08 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetScrollTwo(i)</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes a 64-bit number in the range 0 &le; i &lt; GetLength()</li>
  <li>Returns an uppercase character (in the inclusive range <code>A</code>
    through <code>J</code>) representing the i-th character in the second
    scroll, counting starting from 0, starting from the left.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.08 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output a single line with a single integer: the maximal sum modulo the prime
10<sup>9</sup>+7 (1000000007), as described above.</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
Number of nodes: 100. <b>(Notice that the number of nodes is the same for both the Small and Large
  datasets.)</b><br/>
Time limit: 3 seconds.<br/>
Memory limit per node: 128 MB.<br/>
Maximum number of messages a single node can send: 1000.<br/>
Maximum total size of messages a single node can send: 8 MB.<br/>
1 &le; GetLength() &le; 10<sup>9</sup>.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Small dataset</h4>
<p>
GetScrollOne(i) is either uppercase <code>A</code> or uppercase
<code>B</code>, for all i.<br/>
GetScrollTwo(i) is either uppercase <code>A</code> or uppercase
<code>B</code>, for all i.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Large dataset</h4>
<p>
GetScrollOne(i) is an uppercase letter between <code>A</code> and <code>J</code>, inclusive,
  for all i.<br/>
GetScrollTwo(i) is an uppercase letter between <code>A</code> and <code>J</code>, inclusive,
  for all i.<br/>
</p>
