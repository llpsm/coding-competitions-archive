In our second-ever Distributed Code Jam final round, our contestants contended
with four problems. <i>Encoded Sum</i> was solvable by evenly dividing the work among nodes in a
couple stages, in a manner reminiscent of
<a href="../../2016_r1/crates/statement.html">Rearranging Crates</a>
and <a href="../../2016_r2/lisp_plus_plus/statement.html">Lisp++</a> from our
online rounds.
<i>Air Show</i> required some geometrical knowledge, and special planning on how to do the
distribution, as simple even division didn't cut it. In <i>Toothpick Sculpture</i>, the challenge
lay not in the distribution (since the input came pre-sharded), but in how to combine the results.
Gold was our first "interactive" distributed problem; it was not possible to read all of the input,
and contestants had to issue queries strategically based on information seen so far, and manage
resources dynamically.
Each problem presented a different distribution challenge, and many entailed more traditional
algorithmic challenges as well.
</p><p>
Early on in the 4-hour round, we saw many Small solutions trickle in, and
quite a few contestants picked up the Large dataset for Encoded Sum. As the
contest wore on, we saw a surprising number of solutions to Gold, a very
tough problem; Air Show and Toothpick Sculpture also garnered some attempts.
At the end of the round, our reigning champion bmerry towered above the field,
with all eight datasets submitted. DCJ judging is even more dramatic than GCJ
judging, though, and many Large solutions to Air Show, Toothpick Sculpture,
and Gold fell. Four contestants (bmerry, sevenkplus, fhlasek, and mnbvmar)
were left with 65 points (everything but the Larges for Air Show and Toothpick
Sculpture), and bmerry won via time penalty. There were many resubmissions of
Larges in the last two hours, and their effects on the time penalty proved
decisive!

Congratulations to bmerry for repeating as Distributed Code Jam champion; he
is undefeated in the Finals in the history of the contest! eatmore also
deserves a shout-out for being the only contestant to fully solve Air Show.

GCJ Finals'

Gallery of Pillars</a> problem, got no full solutions.

We'll see you in 2017 for another Distributed Code Jam. We have many
improvements planned, and we look forward to producing another set of
perplexing parallel programming problems!
