<h2>Gold: Analysis</h2>
<h3>A binary search approach</h3>
<p>
Let's try to solve the following subproblem: given two integers L and R (1 &le; L &le; R &le;
<code>RoadLength()</code>), standing for the left and right ends of an interval, determine whether
there is at least one nugget at a position inside the interval [L, R], and if there is, find the
position of one of them.
</p><p>
If one or both of L and R are <code>X</code> (that is, a nugget), we are done. If we find that one
or both are <code>=</code>, we can just move that side of the interval one position toward the
inside. Since there are never two <code>=</code>s in a row, that does not affect the overall
complexity.
</p><p>
If L is <code>&gt;</code> and R is <code>&lt;</code>, it is clear that there is at least one nugget
in the interval. In this case, we can easily find a nugget by binary searching for its position.
Consider the position M = (L + R) / 2. If there is not a nugget at that position, at least one of
[L, M] or [M, R] has at least one nugget (and we know which direction(s) to look in), and so on,
recursively. The complexity is O(log(R - L + 1)).
</p><p>
If L is not <code>&gt;</code>, let's try to find the first <code>&gt;</code> symbol in the interval.
If L is <code>&lt;</code>, let's jump to the position L + 2, because we can be sure that there is
no nugget at L + 1 (otherwise, L would have been <code>&gt;</code> or <code>=</code>). If L + 2 is
<code>&lt;</code>, we can jump to L + 4. (Remember that if we encounter <code>=</code>,
we move one position towards the inside of the interval.) Generally, if we are at position L + p and
we see <code>&lt;</code>, it means that there is no nugget in the interval [L, L+ p + p - 1], so we
can jump to position L + 2 * p, and proceed in this way, doubling our jump length each time, until
we find <code>&gt;</code> or a nugget or reach
R (which means there is no nugget inside the interval).
</p><p>
A symmetric strategy works for finding the first <code>&lt;</code> starting from R and moving left.
So, combining all of the above, for any interval, we can determine whether there is at least one
nugget inside the interval, and the position of one nugget if so, in O(log(R - L + 1)) time.
</p>
<h3>A Small solution</h3>
<p>
Using the above algorithm, we can write and distribute a naive solution. We divide the total
<code>RoadLength()</code> into <code>NumberOfNodes()</code> intervals and have each node find the
XOR of all nuggets in its interval.
</p><p>
On each node, we can keep a queue of intervals that initially holds [L, R]. If we find a nugget at
position N inside the interval [L, R], we should check the two intervals [L, N - 1] and [N + 1, R].
For each nugget, 2 intervals will be added, so at most 2 * (number of nuggets actually present in
[L, R]) + 1 intervals will be examined. The maximum worst-case size of the queue is
<code>NumberOfNuggets()</code> + 1. The complexity of such a solution for a single node is
O(<code>NumberOfNuggets()</code> * log(<code>RoadLength()</code>)). This solution passes the Small,
since the nuggets are approximately evenly distributed; the distribution reduces the complexity by
a factor close to <code>NumberOfNodes()</code>. However, this will be too slow for the Large
dataset, because, for example, the interval assigned to one node might contain all the nuggets.
</p>
<h3>A Large solution</h3>
<p>
Let's introduce the operation <i>Reduce-Road-K</i> which reduces the road at least K times.
Every node will process its interval and check whether there are at least
<code>NumberOfNuggets()</code> / <code>NumberOfNodes()</code> * K nuggets; it will return a special
value (meaning that the interval had too many nuggets) if so, or it will return the XOR of all
discovered nuggets otherwise.
</p><p>
By the pigeonhole principle, at most <code>NumberOfNodes()</code> / K nodes will return this special
value for their corresponding intervals. So the total length we must examine is reduced
to at most <code>RoadLength()</code> / K after one operation of <i>Reduce-Road-K</i>. The intervals
that had too many nuggets, we must re-examine. A master node redistributes this remaining blocks
into the nodes again, for another pass, until all gold has been discovered. We need at most
log<sub>K</sub>(<code>RoadLength()</code>) steps of this process.
</p><p>
The complexity of that deterministic solution for one node is
O(log<sub>K</sub>(<code>RoadLength()</code>) * <code>NumberOfNuggets()</code>
/ <code>NumberOfNodes()</code> * K * log(<code>RoadLength()</code>)).
It is up to the solver to choose a good value of K; we got good results with K = 3.
