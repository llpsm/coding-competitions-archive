<h3>Problem</h3>
<h2>Air Show</h2>
<p>
We are planning an awesome air show. The most impressive act features two airplanes doing acrobatic
moves together in the air. The flight plan for each plane is already finalized. These plans may
cause the planes to get very close to each other, which is dangerous; you have been hired to assess
the extent of this risk.
</p><p>
A flight plan for one plane is a sequence of <b>N</b> timed segments. Within each segment a
plane flies straight at a constant speed. However, a plane may change direction and speed
dramatically when changing segments. Formally, the flight plan consists of an ordered list of
<b>N</b> + 1 3-dimensional points
P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, ..., P<sub><b>N</b></sub> and an ordered list of <b>N</b> transition
times T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub><b>N</b> - 1</sub>. As its i-th move, for each i in
{0, 1, ..., <b>N</b> - 1},
the plane following this plan flies from P<sub>i</sub> to P<sub>i + 1</sub> at a constant
speed in exactly T<sub>i</sub> seconds. Since the planes are working together as a single act,
the sum of the times for each segment must be equal for both planes.
</p><p>
A transition instant is a time in between two consecutive moves (even when two consecutive moves
happen to require no change in speed or direction). That is, the <b>N</b> - 1 transition instants
for a plane with the flight plan above happen exactly at times
T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>0</sub> + T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>0</sub> + T<sub>1</sub> + T<sub>2</sub>, ...,
T<sub>0</sub> + T<sub>1</sub> + ... + T<sub>N - 2</sub>. The starting and finishing times
are not considered transition instants.
</p><p>
Transition instants are the most dangerous times for pilots. Given a minimum safe distance
<b>D</b>, for each plane <i>p</i>, we ask you to count the number of transition instants
when <i>p</i> is at a distance strictly less than <b>D</b> from the other plane. You may consider
each plane to be a single point. If both planes occupy the same point at the same instant, no
collision occurs; the planes just pass through each other and continue.
</p><p>
The arithmetic for this problem for our official solution requires integers with more than 64 bits.
<code>__int128</code> is available in our C++ installation and <code>BigInteger</code> is available
for Java.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library is called "air_show"; see the sample inputs below for examples in your
language. It defines four methods:
<ul>
<li><b>GetSafeDistance()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the minimum safe distance <b>D</b>.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.5 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetNumSegments()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number of segments <b>N</b> of each flight plan.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.5 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetTime(a, i)</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes two 64-bit integers in the ranges 0 &le; a &lt; 2,
      0 &le; i &lt; GetNumSegments().</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the time used for move i of plane a
      (shown as T<sub>i</sub> above).
  </li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.5 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetPosition(a, i)</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes two 64-bit integers in the ranges 0 &le; a &lt; 2, 0 &le;
    i &le; GetNumSegments().</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: an encoding of point i of the flight plan of plane a
    (shown as P<sub>i</sub> above). Point (x, y, z), with each coordinate ranging between
    0 and 2<sup>20</sup>-1, is encoded as the integer
    x &times; 2<sup>40</sup> + y &times; 2<sup>20</sup> + z.
  </li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 2.5 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output a single line with two integers <code>r<sub>0</sub></code> and <code>r<sub>1</sub></code>
separated by a single space, where <code>r<sub>i</sub></code> is the number of dangerous moments
for plane i in which it is strictly closer than GetSafeDistance() to the other plane.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
Number of nodes: 100. <b>(Notice that the number of nodes is the same for both the Small and
  Large datasets.)</b><br/>
Time limit: 14 seconds.<br/>
Memory limit per node: 512 MB.<br/>

</p>

<h4>Small dataset</h4>
<p>
0 &le; GetPosition(a, i) &lt; 2<sup>40</sup>, for all a and i. (The x-coordinate of all points is
0, while coordinates y and z range between 0 and 2<sup>20</sup> - 1.)<br/>
GetTime(a, i) = 1, for all a and i.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Large dataset</h4>
<p>
0 &le; GetPosition(a, i) &lt; 2<sup>60</sup>, for all a and i. (All coordinates range between 0
  and 2<sup>20</sup> - 1.)<br/>
1 &le; GetTime(a, i) &lt; 10<sup>9</sup>, for all a and i.<br/>
  GetTime(0, 0) + GetTime(0, 1) + ... + GetTime(0, GetNumSegments() - 1) =
GetTime(1, 0) + GetTime(1, 1) + ... + GetTime(1, GetNumSegments() - 1). (The sum of all the values
of GetTime(a, _) for each a is the same.)<br/>
GetTime(0, 0) + GetTime(0, 1) + ... + GetTime(0, GetNumSegments() - 1) &le; 10<sup>12</sup>.
  (The total time of a flight plan does not exceed 10<sup>12</sup>.)<br/>

Note that the last 2 sample cases would not appear in the Small dataset.
