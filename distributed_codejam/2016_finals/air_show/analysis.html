<h2>Air Show: Analysis</h2>
<h3>Math, the whole math and nothing but the math</h3>
<p>
We are given two polylines in 3D, along with a time for each segment. Let
  <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>p<sub>1</sub></i>, ..., <i>p<sub><b>N</b></sub></i> to the list of transition
points for airplane 0, with corresponding times <i>t<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>, ...,
<i>t<sub><b>N</b> - 1</sub></i>, such that its i-th move takes <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> time and flies from
point <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> to point <i>p<sub>i + 1</sub></i>. Let
<i>q<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>, ..., <i>q<sub><b>N</b></sub></i> be the list of points
for airplane 1 with corresponding times <i>u<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>u<sub>1</sub></i>, ...,
<i>u<sub><b>N</b> - 1</sub></i>. Given a point <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>, we want to find a corresponding
flight segment of the other airplane [<i>q<sub>j</sub></i>, <i>q<sub>j + 1</sub></i>] such that
while airplane 0 is at <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> airplane 1 is flying that segment. Formally,
that means:<br/>
<i>u<sub>0</sub></i> + <i>u<sub>1</sub></i> + ... + <i>u<sub>j - 1</sub></i> &le;
<i>t<sub>0</sub></i> + <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> + ... + <i>t<sub>i - 1</sub></i> &le;
<i>u<sub>0</sub></i> + <i>u<sub>1</sub></i> + ... + <i>u<sub>j - 1</sub></i> + <i>u<sub>j</sub></i>.<br/>
If we locate such <i>j</i> for each <i>i</i>, we can check whether <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> should be
counted in the final result by checking that the distance between <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> and the point
the point <i>q</i> corresponding to the other plane's location at the same time. We can
get <i>q</i> by linearly interpolating between <i>q<sub>j</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>j + 1</sub></i>.
<br/>
<i>t</i> = <i>t<sub>0</sub></i> + <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> + ... + <i>t<sub>i - 1</sub></i> -
  (<i>u<sub>0</sub></i> + <i>u<sub>1</sub></i> + ... + <i>u<sub>j - 1</sub></i>)<br/>
<i>q</i> = <i>q<sub>j</sub></i> +
  (<i>q<sub>j + 1</sub></i> - <i>q<sub>j</sub></i>) <i>t</i> / <i>u<sub>j</sub></i>.<br/>
While the equations above imply some non-integer division, and the distance checking involves
square roots, it's not hard to manipulate the expressions by squaring and multiplying both sides
to get a pure integer arithmetic expression to check whether point i needs to be counted or not.
That expression does require 128 bit arithmetic, as suggested by the statement.
Of course, checking for a point of airplane 1 is symmetric.

<h3>Single-machine solutions</h3>
<p>
The layout in the previous section lets us write a pretty simple cubic solution: for every point,
check every segment of the other airplane until you find one that matches its timeframe. Since
the number of pairs is quadratic, and our equations above have a linear size sum (to get the
times), the more naive implementation of this approach takes cubic time. The following pseudocode
shows how to get the result for one airplane; the other one is symmetric.
</p><pre>
result = 0
for i = 1 to GetNumSegments() - 1:
  for j = 0 to GetNumSegments() - 1:
    sum_t = SumTimes(0, i)
    sum_u = SumTimes(1, j)
    if sum_u &le; sum_t &le; sum_u + GetTime(1, j):
      if (check using the math above):
        result = result + 1
      break
</pre><p>
where <code>SumTimes</code> is the accumulated time for a given airplane up to a given point, as
follows:
</p><pre>
SumTimes(a, x)
  result = 0
  for i = 0 to x - 1: result = result + GetTime(a, i)
  return result
</pre><p>
It's easy to take this to quadratic by keeping a running total of times instead of calling
<code>SumTimes</code> all the time:
</p><pre>
result = 0
sum_t = 0
for i = 1 to GetNumSegments() - 1:
  sum_t = sum_t + GetTimes(0, i - 1)
  sum_u = 0
  for j = 0 to GetNumSegments() - 1:
    sum_u = sum_u + GetTimes(0, j - 1)
    if sum_u &le; sum_t &le; sum_u + GetTime(1, j):
      if (check using the math above):
        result = result + 1
      break
</pre><p>
And furthermore, noticing that the times are increasing, which means the pairs (point, segment)
are sorted by both coordinates simultaneously, we can pick up the search for a segment where the
last point left off, making the algorithm run in linear time.
</p><pre>
result = 0
sum_t = 0
last_j = 0
for i = 1 to GetNumSegments() - 1:
  sum_t = sum_t + GetTimes(0, i - 1)
  sum_u = 0
  for j = last_j to GetNumSegments() - 1:
    sum_u = sum_u + GetTimes(0, j - 1)
    if sum_u &le; sum_t &le; sum_u + GetTime(1, j):
      if (check using the math above):
        result = result + 1
      last_j = j
      break
</pre>
<h3>A distributed solution</h3>
<p>
Now that we have a linear time solution, all that is left is to distribute it. Giving each machine
a range of indices for the segments and points to consider won't work. Consider a case where
  <code>GetTime(0, 0)</code> = <code>GetTime(1, GetNumSegments() - 1)</code> = 10<sup>12</sup>
and all the other times are 1. You need to compare almost all points from airplane 0 with
the last segment of airplane 1. Of course, most of your machines won't know what to do because they
don't have that segment assigned. Since the pairing of points and segments is time-based, the
solution is giving each machine a range of times instead of indices. However, this can't be done
uniformly, otherwise, a test case with
<code>GetTime(0, 0)</code> = <code>GetTime(1, 0)</code> = 10<sup>12</sup>
and all other times equal to 1 will timeout, because a single machine will be assigned almost all
point/segment pairs.
</p><p>
The solution is to adjust the time ranges to contain roughly the same amount of point/segment pairs.
Or, to simplify, to be able to bound the number of point/segment pairs that a single machine
processes by something close to <code>GetNumSegments()</code> / <code>NumberOfNodes()</code>.
Divide the segments of each plane into <code>NumberOfNodes()</code> / 2 parts of roughly equal
number of segments each
and give each machine one of those ranges to add up the times of all those segments. Then, send
all the partial results to a single machine to get aggregates. In this way, we can calculate
the aggregated time of a particular airplane up to point <i>i</i> for
<code>GetNumSegments()</code> / 2 different values of <i>i</i> that are (roughly) uniformly
distributed between 0 and <code>GetNumSegments()</code>. Two of the numbers are going to be equal
to the total time of the show, so discard those and use the remaining values to separate the total
time into smaller time windows. Note that each window is guaranteed to span no more than
2 <code>GetNumSegments()</code> / <code>NumberOfNodes()</code>, only twice the theoretical
optimum amount. As an implementation detail, we should also couple each window cutting point with
an airplane and an index. That way, we can get a small interval of indices to consider on each
machine: just start at the closest index on the left you have for each airplane. By construction,
this ensures you never iterate more than
2 <code>GetNumSegments()</code> / <code>NumberOfNodes()</code> indices per plane, since after that
many consecutive indices, there is surely a new cutting point. There are other implementation
details to fill in, but we leave those to the reader.
</p>
<h3>A quick word on the Small dataset</h3>
<p>
This problem had a Small that was different than usual. Solving it did not provide much of a
stepping stone, if any, toward solving the Large. Since all times are equal, we know that
airplane 0 will be at its i-th transition point at the same time airplane 1 is at its own
i-th transition point. That means
the answer for both airplanes is the same, and we just need to check whether each of those pairs
of points are closer than the minimum allowed distance. That is easier to do with pure-integer math
than what we outlined above for the general case, and more importantly, it makes things easier to
distribute. This is because the pathological cases (designed to disallow giving each machine a
range of segments or times) that we mentioned can't exist under the highly uniform conditions of
the Small dataset. So, to write a Small-only solution, just give each machine a roughly equal
subset of points from each plane, iterate through them, and count how many pairs are at a dangerous
distance, sending all partial results to a master machine to add up and print out the final result.
