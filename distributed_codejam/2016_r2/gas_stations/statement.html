<h3>Problem</h3>
<h2>Gas Stations</h2>
<p>
You are about to embark on the road trip of a lifetime, covering millions or even billions
of kilometers! Of course, gas for such a long trip can get really expensive, and you are
on a budget, so you should plan ahead. Fortunately, the road you are taking has a lot of
gas stations: there is one at your starting point, one every kilometer thereafter.
There is no gas station at your ending point (not that it would do you any good).
</p><p>
Different gas stations may charge different prices per liter of gas.
Your car is really old, so it can run for exactly 1 kilometer with 1 liter of gas.
You can never have more liters of gas than the tank can hold, but you can add gas to the tank at
any station; you do not need to wait for the tank to be empty.
Each time you advance a kilometer, your tank's contents are reduced by 1 liter. It is OK if the
tank becomes empty exactly at the end of your trip or exactly as you reach a gas station (in which
case you can add gas there).
</p><p>
Given the length of your route, the size of your tank and the price per liter of each station, what
is the minimum amount of money you need to complete your trip? Your starting point is exactly at the
station at the 0 kilometer mark, and your tank starts empty.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library is called "gas_stations"; see the sample inputs below for examples in your
language. It defines three methods:
<ul>
<li><b>GetNumKms()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the total length in kilometers of your trip.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.15 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetTankSize()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the maximum amount of liters of gas you can have in your tank.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.15 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetGasPrice(i)</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes a 64-bit integer in the range 0 &le; i &lt; GetNumKms().</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the price of each liter of gas in the station exactly i kilometers
      from your starting point.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.15 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output a single line with a single integer: the minimum amount of money you need to pay for all the
gas necessary for your trip.
