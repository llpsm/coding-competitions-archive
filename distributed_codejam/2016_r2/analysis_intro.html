The second of our two online distributed rounds consisted of a quartet of
problems. <i>...we did it again</i> is another code analysis and improvement
problem in the same vein as
<a href="../2016_r1/oops/statement.html" target="_blank">Round 1's <i>Oops</i></a>.
<i>Lisp++</i> asks contestants to act like a compiler for a language consisting
only of parentheses. <i>Asteroids</i> is about a dangerous journey through a
slowly advancing asteroid field, and <i>Gas Stations</i> is about a rather less
dangerous journey along a very long road.
</p><p>
The first two problems got many solves relatively quickly; the last two
proved tougher. Our first attempts for Asteroids and Gas Stations came in
at 49:54 and 1:13:55, respectively. Eryx was the first to submit every
dataset (by 1:21:31). The scoreboard filled up with many 100 scores, but after
the judging dust settled, there were only 14; the fastest 75 also made it
into the top 15. eatmore took top honors with a perfect score in 2:09:25; our
runner-up in the 2015 Distributed Finals, Marcin.Smulewicz, took second place.
Our 2015 Distributed Code Jam champion, bmerry, also qualified to defend his
title at the 2016 Finals in New York on August 6.

Thank you all for participating! We are excited to continue growing and
improving the Distributed contest, and we appreciate your feedback.
