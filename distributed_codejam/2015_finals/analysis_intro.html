<p><b>bmerry</b> is the first ever Distributed Code Jam Champion!</p>

<p>The first ever Distributed Code Jam finals are over, and they were a pretty exciting event! With ten participants fighting for the title, we knew the race was going to be pretty intense. The contest was opened by bmerry submitting a solution to the small input for Necklace, followed closely by MiSawa submitting a solution to the small input for Kolakoski, both before the half-hour mark. At this point, the solutions started pouring in - after an hour, all but one contestants had at least one small input to their name, and half of them also having a submission to the large input of Necklace.</p>

<p>The submissions to Necklace large and Kolakoski small continued streaming in. The next breakthrough came at one hour and 40 minutes, when Shik took the lead with a submission to Kolakoski large. He didn't hold it for long, though, as just four minutes later bmerry submitted a solution to Shipping small, followed almost immediately by a submission to Shipping large, netting him a huge advantage over the rest of the contestants.</p>

<p>The other contestants had no way of knowing that while bmerry's small submission was fully correct, the large submission was just a bluff - and a very successful one, as it seems to have focused others on the Shipping problem, instead of the significantly easier Rocks. The solutions to the two easier problems continued streaming in (in particular bmerry strengthened his lead by submitting a solution to Kolakoski large a bit before three hours were up), as did incorrect submissions to Shipping-small.</p>

<p>The two contestants to attack the rocks problem were MiSawa, with a small submission three and a half hours into the contest, but without an attempt on the 53 points to be gained from the large, and bmerry, who submitted the small around two and a half hours in, and tried a slightly too slow submission for the large just before the end of the contest. Meanwhile, most contestants were attacking Shipping, with Marcin.Smulewicz being the only successful one - his successful submission for the small input gave him, in the end, the second place, after bmerry. Shik came in third, with correct large submissions for Kolakoski and Necklace, followed by MiSawa (who had Necklace large, Kolakoski small and Rocks small) and ZbanIlya with Necklace large and Kolakoski small).</p>

<p>Congratulations to the medalists and all the finalists, and hope to see you next year!</p>
