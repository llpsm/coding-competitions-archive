<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
The Kolakoski sequence is defined as follows, where A(i) is the i-th term in the sequence:
<ul>
<li>A(0) = 1</li>
<li>A(1) = 2</li>
<li>The sequence is composed entirely of alternating runs of 1's and 2's</li>
<li>A(i) is the length of the i-th run.</li>
</ul>
This completely and uniquely defines the sequence.
</p>
<p>
The first twenty terms of the sequence are as follows, where the lines mark the alternating runs of 1's and 2's:<br/><br/>
<code>1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1</code><br/>
<code>_ ___ ___ _ _ ___ _ ___ ___ _ ___ ___ _</code><br/>
<code>1&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;1</code><br/><br/>
By collecting the lengths of each run, we obtain the same sequence again.
</p>
<p>
You become mystified contemplating the elegance of the Kolakoski sequence and after staring at its 1's and 2's for far too long, you begin to wonder if maybe you should spice it up a little and introduce some more numerical variety to the terms.
</p>

<p>So you decide to assign an arbitrary coefficient to each index in a manner such as the following:<br/><br/>
C(0)=1<br/>
C(1)=3<br/>
C(2)=1<br/>
C(3)=5<br/>
C(4)=2<br/>
C(5)=2<br/>
<br/>
By multiplying the first 6 terms each by their coefficient and summing, we get<br/><br/>
1*1 + 3*2 + 1*2 + 5*1 + 2*1 + 2*2 = 20.
</p>

<p>
Given a mapping from index to coefficient, find the dot product of the first <b>N</b> terms of the Kolakoski sequence and their respective coefficients.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
The library "kolakoski" will contain two functions:
<ul><li>GetIndex() which returns <b>N</b>, the number of terms we wish to sum; and</li>
<li>GetMultiplier(i) which takes an index i and returns the coefficient (a number from 0 to 50) for that index.</li></ul>
A single call to GetMultiplier will take approximately 0.005 microseconds.

<h3>Output</h3>
Output one number: the weighted sum of the elements of the Kolakoski sequence.

<h3>Limits</h3>
Each node will have access to 700MB of RAM.<br/>
Your solution will run on 100 nodes in both inputs.<br/>

<h3>Small input</h3>
GetMultiplier(i) will always return 1, for all the inputs.<br/>
1 &le; GetIndex() &le; 10<sup>9</sup><br/>
Each node will have a time limit of 10 seconds.<br/>


<h3>Large input</h3>
1 &le; GetMultiplier(i) &le; 50 for all i<br/>
1 &le; GetIndex() &le; 3 &times; 10<sup>9</sup><br/>
Each node will have a time limit of 12 seconds.<br/>
