<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
You've come up with the coolest idea ever for a new fashion trend: customizable necklaces made out of strings with beads that display letters and other characters! The beads appear only on the front of the necklace and read only in one direction, so the string of characters is not circular and irreversible. By itself, this is not really a new idea. The awesome new feature you have in mind is to add a button that lights up some of the beads so that they display a secret message consisting of characters that form a subsequence of the main string of characters. This will have so many applications... just think of the possibilities! And it's so shiny! People are going to love it! Everyone will want their own!
</p>

<p>
So you announce this product, allowing people to place orders for necklaces by specifying the string of characters to be displayed on the necklace as well as the secret message to be lit up when they press the button. The orders come pouring in! Your idea is even more popular than you expected! How exciting!
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, after examining a few orders, you realize that you forgot to check the crucial constraint that the secret message has to be a subsequence of the main necklace string. Without that, the secret message can't always be lit up entirely.
</p>

<p>
You don't want to disappoint your customers by just telling them that it is impossible to light up their secret messages in the chosen necklace strings. So you decide to offer them an alternative message by finding a substring of their secret message that forms a subsequence of their necklace string, in case they would be satisfied with this shorter version. You want to maximize the length of such a substring.
</p>

<p>
Given a necklace string <b>N</b> and a secret message string <b>M</b>, find the maximum length of a substring of <b>M</b> that is also a subsequence of <b>N</b>.
</p>


<h3>Input</h3>
The input library is called "necklace"; see the sample inputs below for examples in your language. It defines four methods:
<ul><li>GetNecklaceLength(), which returns the length of the necklace string</li>
<li>GetNecklaceElement(i), which returns the i-th (0-indexed) element of necklace string</li>
<li>GetMessageLength(), which returns the length of the secret message</li>
<li>GetMessageElement(i), which returns the i-th (0-indexed) element of the secret message.</li></ul>

A single call of GetNecklaceElement or GetMessageElement will take up to 0.02 microseconds.

<h3>Output</h3>
Output one integer - the maximum length of a substring of Message that is also a subsequence of Necklace.

<h3>Limits</h3>
0 &le; GetNecklaceElement(i), GetMessageElement(i) &le; 10,000<br/>
1 &le; GetNecklaceLength() &le; 10<sup>9</sup><br/>
Each node will have access to 256MB of RAM and a time limit of 5 seconds.<br/>
Your solution will run on 100 nodes (both for the small and the large input).<br/>

<h3>Small input</h3>
1 &le; GetMessageLength() &le; 100<br/>

<h3>Large input</h3>
1 &le; GetMessageLength() &le; 3000<br/>
