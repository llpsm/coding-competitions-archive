<h2>Weird Editor: Analysis</h2>
<h3>Small dataset</h3>
<p>
This problem has a deceptively simple single-node solution if tackled
from the right angle. First, notice that the order in which we apply the operations
doesn't matter, so we only need to pick which digits to remove and we can append
the appropriate number of zeroes at the end.
Naturally, we want to prioritize maximizing the most significant digit, then give
second priority to maximizing the second most significant digit, and so on.
We can then see that if the first occurrence of the maximum digit in our number
is at index i, we should remove all digits up to and including index i - 1.
Moreover, if there are any other occurrences of that maximum, we want to remove
any other digits between those occurrences, to ensure that our result starts
with as many copies of the maximum as possible.
</p><p>
Combining the above insights, we can see that we should remove any non-maximum digit
that appears before a maximum digit. What about the digits that follow the last
occurrence of the maximum digit? These represent a smaller instance of the same problem
(with a new maximum digit), so we could solve it in the same way.
This approach can be tricky to implement and can take O(N<sup>2</sup>) time,
where N = <code>GetNumberLength()</code>, in the worst case; a variant that makes one
forward pass through the data for each digit is O(10N) and is fast enough to pass the
Small. (With 10 nodes available for the Small, this solution can even be distributed.)
But we can do even better by approaching the problem in reverse, from the least
significant digit backwards to the most.
</p><p>
Let N = <code>GetNumberLength()</code> and d<sub>i</sub> = <code>GetDigit(i)</code>.
Consider the last digit d<sub>N-1</sub> in the input. It is always optimal to to not
remove it; if it is a zero, removing it does nothing, and otherwise, removing it
would be strictly worse.
Now consider the next to last digit d<sub>N-2</sub>. For any fixed string of digits
s that we choose to keep from among the first N-2, our options for the final value
are either sd<sub>N-2</sub>d<sub>N-1</sub>0000... or sd<sub>N-1</sub>000....
For all s, the former is larger if and only if d<sub>N-2</sub> &ge; d<sub>N-1</sub>.
This same argument generalizes to all digits: we should keep a digit
d<sub>i</sub> if there is no larger digit to its right. Notice that we have arrived
at the same conclusion as before.
</p><p>
We can adapt this idea into a single-node solution as follows: from the least significant
digit to the most significant, keep track of the maximum digit M seen so far, and use the
current digit d<sub>i</sub> if d<sub>i</sub> &ge; M. To accumulate the actual result, we
should also keep a running total T and the number of digits used so far D. Then,
to represent appeding the current digit d<sub>i</sub> to the left of our new number,
we add d<sub>i</sub> &times; 10<sup>D</sup> to T.
At the end, we need to append N-D zeroes to the right, which we can do by multiplying
by 10<sup>N-D</sup>. All operations need to be done modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7 to avoid
overflows. Exponentiating can be done in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">logarithmic time</a> on the
exponent, which makes this solution require only O(N log N) time and a single pass over the
input.

<h3>Large dataset</h3>
<p>
As usual in Distributed Code Jam, even a linear solution is too slow
for the Large dataset, and we need to improve further. If we take the
usual route of dividing the input into <code>NumberOfNodes()</code>
evenly sized chunks so that each worker can handle one of them, we'll
quickly notice that, other than the worker handling the rightmost
piece, each worker is missing the a key piece of information. When
starting from digit d<sub>j</sub> and going backwards, we need to know
the largest digit occurring between indices j+1 and N-1 &mdash; that is,
max(d<sub>j+1</sub>, d<sub>j+2</sub>, ..., d<sub>N-1</sub>) &mdash;
to initialize the "maximum so far" value M from our single-node algorithm.
To calculate those <code>NumberOfNodes()</code> additional values, we can
do a preliminary pass and have each worker send the largest value
from within its range max(d<sub>i</sub>, d<sub>i+1</sub>, ..., d<sub>j</sub>)
for an inclusive range [i, j]. Then, a
single master can do a linear pass and calculate the value needed
for worker k as the maximum of the maxima reported by workers
k+1 through <code>NumberOfNodes()</code>-1. This
preliminary pass technique is similar to the one needed for the
<a href="../../2016_r1/crates/statement.html">
Crates</a> problem from Round 1 of Distributed Code Jam 2016.
</p><p>
Other more complicated single-node solutions can also be distributed effectively,
but with significantly more effort than the right-to-left solution presented here.
