<h3>Problem</h3>

<h2>Weird Editor</h2>

<p>
  You just installed a text editor in your computer to edit a text file containing
  only a positive integer (in base 10). Unfortunately, the editor you installed was
  not as versatile as you would have hoped.
</p>
<p>
  The editor supports only one operation: choosing and removing any digit, and
  concatenating one <code>0</code> (zero) at the right end of the sequence.
  In this way, the length of the digit sequence is always preserved.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, suppose your initial digit sequence is <code>3001</code>. If you applied the
  operation to the third digit from the left, you would obtain <code>3010</code>. If you then
  applied the operation on <code>3010</code> to the second digit form the left, you would obtain
  <code>3100</code>. In this case, <code>3100</code> is the largest result that can be obtained
  using the allowed operation zero or more times.
</p>
<p>
  What is the maximum number that can be the result of applying the allowed operation
  to the given input number zero or more times? Since the output can be a really big number,
  we only ask you to output the remainder of dividing the result by the prime
  10<sup>9</sup>+7 (1000000007).

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library is called "weird_editor"; see the sample inputs below for
examples in your language. It defines two methods:
</p><ul>
<li><b>GetNumberLength()</b>:
  <ul>
    <li>Takes no argument.</li>
    <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number of digits in the number you're
      given.</li>
    <li>Expect each call to take 0.11 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetDigit(i)</b>:
  <ul>
    <li>Takes a 64-bit integer in the range 0 &le; i &lt;
      GetNumberLength().</li>
    <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: The i-th digit in the given number. Digits
      are numbered from left (most significant) to right (least significant).
      That is, GetDigit(0) is the most significant digit and
      GetDigit(GetNumberLength() - 1) is the least significant digit.</li>
    <li>Expect each call to take 0.11 microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  Output a single integer: the maximum number that can be obtained by applying the allowed
  operation to the input number zero or more times. Output that number modulo the prime
  10<sup>9</sup>+7 (1000000007).
