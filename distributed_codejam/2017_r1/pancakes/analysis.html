into Distributed Code Jam! In this case, we want to serve them from a huge stack.
</p><p>
As a first approach, we can consider simulating the described process: go around the table checking
the top of the stack and serving as appropriate, counting the number of times we complete a full
revolution. We can see that, for some of the largest cases, this is not very efficient. It is not
hard (give it a try!) to devise a case where we have to skip almost all of the diners in order to
serve the top pancake. Luckily, we can achieve the needed speed up with a simple idea: instead of
trying every possible diner, we can jump directly to the one that will get the next pancake in the
stack. When jumping, we have to check whether we complete a revolution. This is easy to verify as
we know we complete a revolution every time we serve diner <i>j</i> right after diner <i>i</i>,
with <i>j</i> &lt; <i>i</i>.
</p><p>
This means we can rephrase the problem in more straightforward way for a program: count the number
of consecutive pairs of integers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> in the input sequence such that
<i>b</i> &lt; <i>a</i>. This is trivial to do in a single node, and not so hard to distribute
either: just split the input into evenly sized parts, give one part to each worker and have it
count only the decreasing consecutive pairs in it. We have to be a careful now because we don't
need to split the input itself, but the comparisons that need to be checked. They involve two
indices each, so we need the last element of a piece to be also considered by the node which
counts the following piece. As an example, if worker 0 reads the input between indices 0 and 9999,
for instance, it will be counting 9998 inversions, and worker 1 will need to read starting at 9999,
not 10000, to be able to compare the numbers at positions 9999 and 10000. Since the number of
duplicate readings is so small, just one extra call per node, it won't heavily impact our running
time. After each node made its share of comparisons, it can just ship the total number of
revolutions it found to a single master, which adds them all up and prints the final result.
