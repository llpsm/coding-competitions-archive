<h3>Problem</h3>

<h2>Pancakes</h2>

<p>
  At the Infinite House of Pancakes, <b>D</b> hungry diners are seated
  around a circular table. They are numbered from 0 at the top
  of the table and clockwise around to <b>D</b>-1. Each diner likes a
  particular type of pancake: the type with the same number as the
  diner.
</p>
<p>
  You are a pancake server with a stack of pancakes. You are currently
  at the top of the table (just about to serve diner 0), and
  you will walk around the table clockwise, perhaps multiple
  times. Every time you pass by a diner, if the pancake at the top of
  the stack is the diner's preferred kind, you will serve that
  pancake. You will keep serving that diner until the top of the stack
  no longer matches the diner's preference; then you will move on to
  the next diner, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  Each time you complete a revolution, after passing by
   diner <b>D</b>-1 and before reaching diner 0 again, you
   check to see if the stack is empty.  If so, you are done.
   Otherwise, you continue clockwise around the table for another
   revolution, serving the diners.
</p>
<p>
  For example, suppose there are 4 diners and 4 pancakes in the
  stack 3, 1, 2, 0 in order from top to bottom. You start your first
  revolution by skipping
  diners 0, 1 and 2 to serve diner 3 the top pancake, getting the
  stack down to 1, 2, 0. After that, you go back to diner 0
  (starting a second revolution), skipping it
  to get to diner 1 and giving her pancake 1, getting the stack down
  to 2, 0. Since she doesn't like pancake 2, you go to diner 2, which
  gets it and you have only a single pancake 0 left. To serve it, you
  go through diner 3 and back to 0 (starting a third revolution),
  who gets the final pancake, and your job is done. You required 3
  revolutions in total for this particular arrangement, even though
  you didn't need to finish the last one completely.
</p>
<p>
  Note that there may be some diners who do not receive any pancakes.
</p>
<p>
  Given the initial stack of pancakes, how many revolutions will you
  make around the table?
</p>


<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library is called "pancakes"; see the sample inputs below for
examples in your language. It defines three methods:
</p><ul>
<li><b>GetStackSize()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the initial number of pancakes in the stack.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.8 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetNumDiners()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number <b>D</b> of diners seated around the table.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.8 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetStackItem(i)</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes a 64-bit number in the range 0 &le; i &lt; GetStackSize().</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the i-th pancake type in the stack, where
    i = 0 corresponds to the first one we plan to serve.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.8 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  Output a single integer: the number of revolutions we make around
  the table.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<h4>Large dataset</h4>

The first sample case is the one explained in the statement.
