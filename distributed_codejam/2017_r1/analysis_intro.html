  Our third Distributed Code Jam tournament is underway! Our first round started
  with <i>Pancakes</i> &mdash; our third pancake-themed problem of 2017 &mdash;
  in which the distribution method was relatively straightforward.
  <i>Weird Editor</i> required a greedy aha and some more thought on how to
  parallelize that insight. <i>Todd and Steven</i> brought part of the
  classic "how would you sort a million/billion integers?" problem to DCJ.
  Finally, <i>Query of Death</i> added a new wrinkle to DCJ: some of the nodes
  would "stop working" as your code ran, and you had to work around that
  dynamically!
</p><p>
  We had almost 1000 contestants on the scoreboard this time, and there were
  an impressive 67 perfect scores! Top honors went to mk.al13n, who reached
  100 at 1:21:13, with a penalty time ten minutes ahead of semiexp., our
  second-place finisher. To meet the top-500 threshold for advancement, you
  needed to earn at least 37 points (which corresponded to A + B + C-small)
  sufficiently quickly. We apologize for the high latency on judging Smalls
  toward the end of the contest.
</p><p>
  The top 500 from this round will compete in Distributed Round 2 in three
  weeks. There are twenty chances to head to the World Finals in Dublin! Which
  familiar faces will return, and which new challengers will appear?
