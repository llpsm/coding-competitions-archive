<h3>Problem</h3>

<h2>Query of Death</h2>

<p>
  We planned a nice simple warm-up DCJ problem for you this year: find the sum
  of many values. You can call a <code>GetLength()</code> function to get the
  number of values and a <code>GetValue(i)</code> function to get the i-th of
  those values; to make it even easier, each of those values is either 0 or 1.
  Simple, right? Unfortunately, we have been having a technical difficulty, and
  now the contest is starting and it is too late to fix it.
</p><p>
  The issue is that there is exactly one value of i &mdash; we are not sure
  what that value is, but we will call it i<sub>qod</sub> &mdash; that is a
  "query of death" (a term occasionally used at Google for a query with severe
  adverse effects) that causes the following malfunction. The first time that
  GetValue(i<sub>qod</sub>) is called on a node, the function will return the
  correct i<sub>qod</sub>-th value. However, this will cause the GetValue
  function to "break" on that node. After that, <i>every</i> future call to
  GetValue(i) on that node will return 0 or 1 purely at (pseudo)random,
  independently of the value of i or of any previous calls. Other nodes are
  not affected when a node breaks in this way, but the malfunction can still
  happen in the future: any other node on which you call
  GetValue(i<sub>qod</sub>) will also break.
</p><p>
  The i<sub>qod</sub> value that causes the breakage is the same for every node
  within a test case; it may vary across test cases, though. Nodes do not
  remain broken across different test cases.
</p><p>
  As an example, suppose that we have two unbroken nodes A and B, and two
  values i<sub>ok</sub> and i<sub>qod</sub>. Then the following sequence of
  calls would produce the following results:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>GetValue(i<sub>ok</sub>) on node A: the correct value is returned.</li>
  <li>GetValue(i<sub>qod</sub>) on node A: the correct value is returned, but
    node A breaks.</li>
  <li>GetValue(i<sub>ok</sub>) on node B: the correct value is returned.</li>
  <li>GetValue(i<sub>ok</sub>) on node A: a random value is returned.</li>
  <li>GetValue(i<sub>qod</sub>) on node A: a random value is returned.</li>
  <li>GetValue(i<sub>qod</sub>) on node B: the correct value is returned, but
    node B breaks.</li>
  <li>GetValue(i<sub>qod</sub>) on node B: a random value is returned.</li>
  <li>GetValue(i<sub>ok</sub>) on node B: a random value is returned.</li>
  <li>GetValue(i<sub>qod</sub>) on node A: a random value is returned.</li>
  <li>GetValue(i<sub>ok</sub>) on node A: a random value is returned.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  We apologize for the inconvenience, but can you find the sum anyway?
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
  The input library is called "query_of_death"; see the sample inputs below for
  examples in your language. It defines two methods:
<ul>
<li><b>GetLength()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the total number of values to be summed up.
    (This function still works correctly even on a broken node.)</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.2 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetValue(i)</b>:
  <ul>
    <li>Takes a 64-bit number in the range 0 &le; <code>i</code> &lt;
      <code>GetLength()</code>.</li>
    <li>Returns a 32-bit number (which is always either 0 or 1): the
      <code>i</code>-th value if the node is not broken, or 0 or 1 at
      (pseudo)random if the node is broken.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.2 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output a single line with one integer: the sum of all of the values.

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
Time limit: 2 seconds.<br/>
Memory limit per node: 128 MB.<br/>
Maximum number of messages a single node can send: 1000.<br/>
Maximum total size of messages a single node can send: 8 MB.<br/>
There is exactly one i<sub>qod</sub> value, which is the same for each node,
and it is within the allowed range for GetLength().<br/>
0 &le; GetValue(i) &le; 1, for all i.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Small dataset</h4>
<p>
Number of nodes: 10.<br/>
1 &le; GetLength() &le; 10<sup>4</sup>.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Large dataset</h4>
<p>
Number of nodes: 100.<br/>
1 &le; GetLength() &le; 10<sup>8</sup>.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  The code for the samples simulates the node-breaking behavior described in
  the statement; the actual test cases have the specified behavior, but the
  implementation (e.g., of randomness on a broken node) is not necessarily the
  same.
