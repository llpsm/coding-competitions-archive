<h3>How to solve the problem non-distributedly</h3>
<p>
In this problem we are given an arrangement of crate stacks and we have to move the crates around
to make them evenly distributed. Let us consider these starting stack heights:
<code>4, 3, 1, 3</code>.
</p><p>
There are a total of 11 crates for 4 stacks. By the definition of the statement, we need 3 crates in
each of the leftmost 3 stacks and 2 crates in the rightmost stack.
</p><table>
<tr><td>starting height</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>target height</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>difference</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>-2</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table><p>
As you can see in the difference row, some stacks will need adjustment.
</p><p>
Notice that the movement of crates is commutative. That is, if we have a set of instructions of the
form "move from crate i to crate j", any order of executing them produces the same result. So, we
can consider the moves in increasing order of the index of the stack from which crates are removed.
</p><p>
It is never optimal to move a crate from stack i to stack j and later a crate
from stack j to stack i, since we can achieve a strictly better solution by avoiding both moves.
Since we can only move crates to adjacent stacks, we should never move more than the 1 excess crate
out of the leftmost stack in the example above. The only place to move the extra crate is the
neighboring stack to the right, so we just do that, getting to the following state:
</p><table>
<tr><td>starting height</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>target height</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>difference</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>-2</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table><p>
Now we have to process the second stack, and we cannot move any crates back to the first! So, we
are in a similar situation as before, and with a single additional move we get to:
</p><table>
<tr><td>starting height</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>target height</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>difference</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>-1</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table><p>
Now we get to a stack that has a negative difference. That means we have to bring crates to it.
However, we can just do that greedily, as everything to the left is already balanced. We just bring
crates from our right neighbor. Even if that leaves the right neighbor with too few crates, we will
fix that in the next step. One more move yields:
</p><table>
<tr><td>starting height</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3<td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>target height</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>difference</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table><p>
Now we are at the last stack, and of course this has to be balanced, as we have no further stack to
the right to move crates to or bring crates from. With 3 moves, balanced the stacks in this test
case.
</p><p>
Generalizing what we did in the previous example, we can always greedily choose to balance each
stack by moving crates to or bringing crates from its right neighbor, as long as we process stacks
from left to right. Moreover, we can even "owe" a stack crates: for instance, if our initial state
was <code>0 0 3</code>, our first greedy move would be to move one crate from the middle stack to
the left, getting to <code>1 -1 3</code>. This poses no problem: the -1 represents a debt
that will eventually be paid. In this case, processing the second stack would require two moves
to get 2 crates from its right neighbor and get to <code>1 1 1</code>. As we observed at the
beginning, the move order is interchangeable, and it is easy to see that there is always an order
that leaves no stack in negative size. Notice that, as before, there is no other way for the
stack on the left to get its missing crate than to eventually get it from the middle stack, so
that decision must be correct.
</p><p>
To formalize the solution: it should take exactly
Moves(i) = |sum of (DesiredHeight(j) - GetStackHeight(j)) over all j &le; i| moves to balance the
stack in position <code>i</code>. Notice that the summation accounts for whatever changes we did
when processing stacks to its left.
This is pretty straightforward to do in linear time non-distributed code:
</p><pre>
sum = 0
result = 0
for i in range:
  sum = sum + (GetStackHeight(i) - DesiredHeight(i))
  result = result + |sum|
</pre><p>
where <code>DesiredHeight</code> is pretty easy to implement in constant time.
</p>
<h3>How to distribute the solution</h3>
<p>
As is usually the case in Distributed Code Jam, linear time is just not fast enough for the
Large dataset. Since the result is just the sum of something for each index <code>i</code>, can
we just distribute that sum in the same way that our
<a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/distributed_guide.html">example codes</a>
distribute a summation of the input, by making each node sum operate over a particular interval of
indices?
</p><p>
The answer, unfortunately, is no. And the reason is that the value of <code>sum</code> in the
pseudocode above depends on all previous indices, not just those on a local range, so distributing
it naively will make each node wait on its left neighbor, thus removing any speedup due to
parallelization. To avoid the wait, we could make each node calculate its own starting value for
sum, but that doesn't really work either.
For instance, if some node processes indices <code>i</code> between 101 and 200, we would need
<code>sum</code> to start with the sum of all indices up to 100. For a node that processes
indices between 201 and 300, we would need the sum for all indices up to 200. You can
easily see that the node that processes the right-most end of the interval needs to know the sum of
all other indices, which requires reading the entire input.
</p><p>
However, we can do an earlier pass in which we calculate the starting value of <code>sum</code> for
each node, so that a node only needs to read the part of the input it is assigned to
process. Since <code>sum</code> is just the cumulative function of
<code>GetStackHeight(i) - DesiredHeight(i)</code>, we can make each node sum over the
<code>i</code>s that it is assigned, send that sum to the master, and make the master calculate the
cumulative sums and send each node the one it needs. Of course, we need to do an
even earlier pass to get DesiredHeight(i) in the first place, since it depends
on the sum of all of the stack heights. Pseudo-code follows:
</p><pre>
On every node:
  compute sum of heights of all stacks in my_range
  send sum to master
Only on master:
  compute the (at most two) DesiredHeight value(s)
  send to all nodes
On every node:
  sum = 0
  result = 0
  for i in my_range:
    sum = sum + (GetStackHeight(i) - DesiredHeight(i))
  send sum to master
Only on master:
  cumulative_sum = 0
  for each node, in increasing order of assigned intervals:
    receive sum and store in node_sum
    send the node cumulative_sum as its starting value for sum
    cumulative_sum += node_sum
On every node:
  receive cumulative_sum and store in sum
  do the single node solution and send result to master
Only on master:
  receive result from every node and sum them to obtain the final result
</pre>
