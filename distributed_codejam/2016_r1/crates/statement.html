<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
You are the manager of the warehouse of the largest wharf in the area. The
warehouse is tall and long, but narrow, so you have created a single row of
stacks of crates. Unfortunately, the ship unloaders are usually sloppy and in a
rush, so the number of crates can vary wildly between stacks, making them look
like an uneven skyline of buildings.
</p><p>
The District Crate Judge (DCJ) is visiting the facilities tomorrow, and you
want to get a perfect score in her assessment. You decided to use an old crane
to rearrange the crates to make them into a neatly organized crate wall that
will impress the DCJ, but this task may take a long time! Your crane can only
handle one crate at a time. Moreover, the crane's wheels are not strong enough
to move if the crane is handling a crate, so the crane can only drop off a
crate on a stack adjacent to the one the crate came from.
</p><p>
The crane starts off at the leftmost stack, without any crates. The crane can
carry out only the following sequence of actions, which we will call a
<i>move</i>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Position the crane at any stack with at least one crate. This may be the
stack the crane is already at.</li>
<li>Pick up the top crate from the stack the crane is at. (Even if this causes
the stack to have zero crates, it still counts as a stack.)</li>
<li>Put that crate on top of a stack directly adjacent to the stack the
crane is at.
</ol>
<p>
Notice that if you want to move a crate two stacks down to the right, for
example, this will take two moves.
</p><p>
You must use some number of moves to transfer crates around so that all stacks
are as even as possible, with all the excess distributed among the leftmost
possible stacks. If there are <i>N</i> stacks and a total of <i>C</i> crates,
you want the <i>C</i>%<i>N</i> leftmost stacks to have &lceil;
<i>C</i>/<i>N</i> &rceil; crates each and the rest of the stacks to have
&lfloor; <i>C</i>/<i>N</i> &rfloor; crates each. For instance, if there are 3
stacks and a total of 8 crates, you want the stack heights to be 3, 3, 2, from
left to right.
</p><p>
What is the minimum number of moves you need to use to balance the stacks as
specified above? Since the result can be really big, output it modulo
10<sup>9</sup>+7 (1000000007).
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library is called "crates"; see the sample inputs below for examples in your
language. It defines two methods:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Method name and parameters</th><th>Parameter limits</th><th>Returns</th>
    <th>Approximate time for a single call</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GetNumStacks()</td><td></td><td>the number of stacks</td><td>0.12 microseconds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GetStackHeight(i)</td><td>1 &le; i &le; GetNumStacks()</td>
    <td>the starting number of crates in stack i, counting from left to right
and starting from 1</td>
    <td>0.12 microseconds</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output a single line with a single integer, the remainder of dividing the
minimum number of moves needed to balance the stacks by 10<sup>9</sup>+7
(1000000007).
