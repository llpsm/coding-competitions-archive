<h2>Oops: Analysis</h2>
<h3>Deducing the original problem</h3>
<p>
Now that we think about it, our sample code might not have been as efficient as
it could have been! Let's look at the C++ version: what is it doing?
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a mysterious <code>GetNumber</code> function that takes a single
input &mdash; a nonnegative number less than <b>N</b> &mdash; and returns a
number. So, notionally, there is a list of <b>N</b> numbers that the code reads
from.</li>
<li>On the k-th node, we examine all possible pairs (i, j) from this list,
but then we only process the ones for which j modulo <b>NumberOfNodes</b>
equals k.</li>
<li>When a node processes a pair (i, j), it finds the value i - j. It stores
the largest such value it has seen so far, and whenever it finds a larger one,
it updates its stored value and sends the new value to the master node.</li>
<li>The master node processes all incoming values, one node at a time, and
takes the largest of those values.</li>
<li>Since every pair (i, j) will be handled by one of the nodes, the code,
when run on all nodes, will find the largest difference between two numbers
in the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>
So the original statement must have been something like "Given a list of
<b>N</b> numbers, what is the largest possible difference between them?" Yes,
that sounds about right. How did we forget that?
</p><p>
<h3>The sample code's approach</h3>
<p>
Now that we know what we are supposed to be doing, we can assess how well the
sample code does it:
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>Each node iterates through all <b>N</b><sup>2</sup> combinations of
selections from <b>N</b>, even though it only acts on a fraction of them.</li>
<li>Whenever a node finds a difference that is larger than the largest
difference it has previously seen, it just can't wait to tell the master about
it, and immediately sends a message with that difference. This creates a lot of
traffic over the network.</li>
<li>The master must wait for a node to finish sending all of these messages
(followed by a DONE message), and then process all of them, before receiving
messages from the next node.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
This approach has an O(<b>N</b><sup>2</sup>) searching phase, since all nodes
operate in parallel. Note that this running time of this phase does not
improve if we add more nodes.
</p><p>
There are cases in which each node produces a large number of messages; for
example, in the case in which the i-th element of <b>N</b> is i, each node
will produce <b>N</b> messages. In a case like this, the master has a total of
<b>NumberOfNodes</b> * <b>N</b> messages to handle in the processing phase. It
is a bad sign that the only part of our distributed solution that depends
on the number of nodes gets <i>worse</i> with more nodes!
</p><p>
Since <b>NumberOfNodes</b> << <b>N</b> in general, the searching phase
dominates the processing phase, and the overall running time is
O(<b>N</b><sup>2</sup>) overall. This is rather embarrassing. We only vaguely
remember writing this code after a long night at our favorite dance club, but
that is no excuse! Now that we have our wits about us, how can we do better?
</p>
<h3>A better approach</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Observe that the largest difference between two numbers in our list will be
between the largest and smallest numbers in the list. This reduces the problem
to finding those largest and smallest values.</li>
<li>We can give each node an equal portion of the list. Each node can look
through its portion, find the locally largest and smallest numbers, and send
those to the master.</li>
<li>The master can receive all of the (locally largest, locally smallest) pairs
and find the globally largest and smallest numbers. Then it can compute and
return the difference between those extremes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this approach, we make a single parallelized pass over the data, so the
running time of the search phase is O(<b>N</b> / <b>NumberOfNodes</b>). The
processing phase has an O(<b>NumberOfNodes</b>) running time. Again, since
<b>NumberOfNodes</b> << <b>N</b> in general, and the master only has to
process two values from each node, the search phase dominates and the overall
running time is O(<b>N</b> / <b>NumberOfNodes</b>) &mdash; much better!
Note that a single-node version of this method is O(<b>N</b>), which is still
better than our sample code.
