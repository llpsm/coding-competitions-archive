<h2>Remarkably Parallel Scenario: Analysis</h2>
<p>
The title playfully refers to <i>Rather Perplexing Showdown</i>,
the other "RPS" problem from Saturday's Round 2, but it also alludes to the
convenient parallelizability of the tournament tree structure. There is one
wrinkle, though: it is not so convenient to divide up a single-elimination
tournament tree based on powers of 2 into exactly 100 independent parts! It is
much more natural to divide such a tree into 2<sup><i>K</i></sup> independent
parts, each of which is the subtree that determines one of the players in the
<i>K</i>th from last round of the tournament. Fortunately, it is easy to use a
number of nodes less than 100, even though your code will run on all of them;
simply have the unwanted nodes exit immediately, and never send any messages to
them or receive any messages from them.
</p><p>
For example, for <b>N</b> = 25, we can evenly divide the starting lineup among
64 nodes, with node 0 handling the first 2<sup>25</sup> / 64 = 2<sup>19</sup>
players, node 0 handling the next 2<sup>19</sup> players, and so on. In this
way, the i-th node operates on the subtree of the tournament that produces the
i-th player (counting starting from 0) in the round with 64 players, and these
subtrees are totally independent of one another. We can have each node send its
winning player's ID back to a master node, and then the master can finish off
the 64-player tournament, which is a much smaller version of the original
problem.
</p><p>
Both the master node and the worker nodes (the master can also be a worker) can
use the same function to determine a tournament winner. One possibility is to
store all of the players for a given node in a vector, go through that vector
comparing adjacent pairs and finding winners, populate another vector of half
the size (or even overwrite the same vector), and so on. The limit on <b>N</b>
is small enough that there is no need to optimize this part.
</p><p>
It is important not to assume that the Large dataset will consist only of
maximal cases. If you hard-code in a choice of 64 nodes, for example, your
solution might fail on a case like <b>N</b> = 3 (which only has 8 players),
depending on your implementation.
