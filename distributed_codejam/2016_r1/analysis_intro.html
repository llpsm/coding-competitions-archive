This year's Distributed Code Jam Round 1 was a new addition to the beginning
of the DCJ track, so the problems were easier on the whole than last year's DCJ
Round 1 problems... but writing distributed code is inherently tricky, so it
was no cake walk! The round was open to all GCJ Round 2 qualifiers, and we had
over four times as many participants on the scoreboard as last year. With this
growth came a few bumps, and time constraints precluded some of the changes we
wanted to make for this year; we hope that most of you had a smooth experience,
and we will continue to improve and polish the contest.

<i>Oops</i> presented some poorly written distributed code and asked contestants
to decipher and rewrite it. <i>Remarkably Parallel Scenario</i> was a callback
to GCJ Round 2's rock-paper-scissors problem, although this one took a different
angle and was more straightforward. For <i>Crates</i>, it was perhaps a bit tricky
even to come up with a single-node solution, and distributing it took some extra
work. Finally, <i>The Only Winning Move</i> was a somewhat experimental problem,
and the first DCJ problem that required linear communication; we intended a
MapReduce-style solution. It was worth a lot, and it was easy to miss it by
using too much memory (e.g. from a doubling vector), but as with some of our Qual Round D problems, it did not substantially influence advancement. About 50 contestants solved the Large.

simonlindholm, one of our ten DCJ finalists from 2015, submitted an eighth correct
answer at the nifty time of 1:11:11, attaining the first perfect score with a total
penalty time of 1:15:11. simonlindholm was followed by tomconerly, eatmore, cgy4ever,
and 2015 DCJ champion bmerry. There were enough competitors that advancing was no sure
thing; provisionally, the cutoff is around 33 points (B-Large, C-Large, E-Small) plus a bit of speed. As usual, official emails will follow within a few days.

We'll see our top 500 in two weeks for the second of our two online DCJ rounds on June 12.
