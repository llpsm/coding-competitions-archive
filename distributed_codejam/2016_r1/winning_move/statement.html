<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
Perhaps you have played this game before: Every player submits a positive
integer. The winner, if any, is the player who submitted the smallest positive
integer that was submitted by no other player.
</p>
<p>
Your friends invited you to play this game, but you decided that game theory is
complex and the only winning move is not to play. Instead, you volunteered to
judge the game. Given the players' choices, can you determine what the winning
number was?
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library will be called "winning_move"; see the sample inputs below
for examples in your language. It will define two methods: GetNumPlayers(),
which will return the number of players in the game, and GetSubmission(i),
which will return the number chosen by the player with ID number i, for 0 &le;
i &lt; GetNumPlayers().
