  In the second of our two online DCJ rounds, contestants contended with four
  more distributed challenges. <i>Flagpoles</i> was by far the most accessible
  of the four, with many possible solutions. <i>Number Bases</i> required a
  combination of mathematical reasoning and careful distribution of an addition
  with carries. <i>Broken Memory</i> presented a situation superficially
  similar to the one in the first online round's
  <a href="../../2017_r1/query_of_death/statement.html" target="_blank"><i>Query of Death</i></a>,
  in which nodes could behave unreliably... but the solution method was rather
  different this time. Finally, the tough <i>Nanobots</i> was approachable
  using a distribution technique similar to one that worked for one of our 2016
  Finals problems.

  By the end of the first hour of the contest, at least one Large solution had
  been submitted for each problem, and complete submissions started coming in
  around the two-hour mark. Many solutions to E-large poured in in the last few
  minutes of the contest, and before judging, we had many more 100s on the
  board then there are slots for advancement. But once judging was complete,
  only 14 perfect scores and 31 E-large solutions remained. To advance, it was
  necessary but not sufficient to solve E-large; the cutoff was a sufficiently
  fast 75 points. fagu emerged the winner with a penalty time of 2:30:37, our
  defending champion bmerry was second, and krijgertje was third (and had the
  first perfect score with no wrong tries or Large resubmissions).

  Our 21 advancers have one more challenge left: the Distributed World Finals!
  These will take place in Dublin, one day before the regular Code Jam World
  Finals. As a reminder, the results for both rounds are provisional until
  official advancement emails are sent, but it currently appears that five
  contestants will compete in both Finals; could one of them win both? That
  could be tough, since the competitions do not test exactly the same
  skillsets; this year, there is no overlap among the top 5 qualifiers for both
  Finals. But anything can happen in DCJ; join us in August to find out who
  will take the title!
