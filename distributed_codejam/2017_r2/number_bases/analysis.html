<h2>Number Bases: Analysis</h2>
<h3>A non-distributed solution</h3>
<p>
Even for the Small limits, checking a single base for correctness is time consuming, so trying
many bases is a non-starter proposition. Luckily, we have our math training. You may have
learned about doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#Carry">addition by carry</a>
in elementary school, and possibly learned about how that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#Addition_in_other_bases">generalizes to
arbitrary bases</a> some time later. Either way, we can try to simulate the carry algorithm,
deferring the decision of what base we are using for as long as we can.
</p><p>
To simplify, we'll let X[i] denote the i-th digit of X (that is, <code>GetX(i)</code>, with
increasing i meaning more significant digits), and we'll define Y[i] and Z[i] similarly.
We start by adding X[0] + Y[0], remembering that we need (X[0] + Y[0]) % B = Z[0].
</p><ul>
<li>If X[0] + Y[0] = Z[0], the requirement always holds for valid bases and there is no carry
in any of those.</li>
<li>If X[0] + Y[0] &lt; Z[0], the case is IMPOSSIBLE, since we already know that B &gt; Z[0]
and this implies (X[0] + Y[0]) % B = X[0] + Y[0].</li>
<li>If X[0] + Y[0] > Z[0], then B = X[0] + Y[0] - Z[0], so Z[0] is the result for the
current column and there is 1 to carry. (We must continue to investigate these and other
digits, though, to make sure that X + Y = Z really is valid under base B. In particular,
we should check that X[0], Y[0] and Z[0] are all greater than B, either at this point or
later.)</li>
</ul><p>
Notice that, if we have more than one candidate base after the first column
(i.e., X[0] + Y[0] = Z[0]), there was no carry, so we can repeat the check above for the second
column. If there is one base candidate, we only need to simulate the addition in that base and
check that it works. All in all, we can decide with a single linear pass over the input whether
we have a single base, multiple bases, or no base. It's important to check that the found base
is larger than all digits (including the ones seen before we found a single candidate base),
either by remembering a running maximum digit seen, or by doing a second pass to check.
</p><p>
There is a two-pass strategy that greatly simplifies the algorithm. On a first pass, see if
there is any column i such that X[i] + Y[i] &ne; Z[i]. If there aren't any, the answer is
NON-UNIQUE. If there is, use the least significant of those (i.e., the minimum such i) one
to determine if there is a base candidate B (or if there is none and so the result is
IMPOSSIBLE). It won't work to use columns other than the least significant one with a
difference, because they may depend on some carry that changes the calculations. If the
least significant column yields a candidate base B, just run a second pass to check that
all digits are less than B, and whether the addition holds. If the check is good, B is the
answer; otherwise, it is IMPOSSIBLE.
</p><p>
The described non-distributed algorithm is enough to solve the Small dataset on a single node.
</p>
<h3>A distributed solution</h3>
<p>
As usual, even a linear algorithm is not fast enough for the Large dataset unless we
distribute it. The two-pass version of the algorithm above is the easiest to distribute.
First, assign each node a consecutive portion of each input (digit i of all of X, Y and Z
should be assigned to the same machine) such that each node gets about 1/100th of the total.
Then, the first pass is easy to distribute: each node can report back to the master the
minimum i such that X[i] + Y[i] &ne; Z[i] in its range, if there is one, and the master
can choose among those, if there is one. After that, the master can decide on a result or
a candidate B, that it can report back to the nodes to do the check in their assigned
portion. Checking for all digits to be less than B is simple, but checking the addition is
a little more nuanced. Nodes treating ranges that are not the least significant one need
to know whether there is a carry. Fortunately, if a node is treating a range [i, j] of
positions, checking position i-1 is enough to know if there is carry at position i. If
X[i-1] + Y[i-1] &gt; Z[i-1], then there is a carry. Otherwise, there is definitely not a
carry, because B is at least 2 and this precludes the possibility of an additional 1 due to
carry from position i-2. Thus, each node can check its own range to see if base B is indeed
possible and then report back to the master. If all nodes report yes, the master can output
B. Otherwise, the master can output IMPOSSIBLE.
</p><p>
Even without using the trick to check only the column i-1 to decide whether or not the
range [i, j] starts with some carry, there is the possibility of having each node calculate
two answers: one that assumes that there is an initial carry, and one that assumes there is
not. As part of each answer, each node also reports whether it's sending any carry out of its
last column. Then, the master can process them from least to most significant, picking the
appropriate answer from each pair.

<h3>A "polynomial" solution</h3>
<p>
A more theory-intensive but possibly simpler way to solve the problem is to
see the sequences as polynomials in a single variable B. Then, the equation is true if and only
if the polynomial P = X + Y - Z evaluates to 0 for a given value of B.
If X[i] + Y[i] - Z[i] = 0 for all i, then P = 0, and thus any sufficiently large integer is a valid
base, so the answer is NON-UNIQUE. Otherwise, using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem">rational root theorem</a>, we can
limit the number of roots of P to positive divisors of
|X[i] + Y[i] - Z[i]| for the smallest i such that |X[i] + Y[i] - Z[i]| is not zero.
The largest such divisor is |X[i] + Y[i] - Z[i]|, and the second largest is at most
|X[i] + Y[i] - Z[i]|/2, which is necessarilly not greater than one of X[i], Y[i] or Z[i], and
hence, not a valid base. Therefore, B = |X[i] + Y[i] - Z[i]| is the only candidate base (we stated
this before, with a different proof). To check that candidate base B, we can evaluate P(B) modulo Q,
for a few large prime values of Q. If P(B) mod Q is non-zero for any Q > 1, then P(B) is certainly
non-zero. Otherwise, it is zero with probability ~1/Q. After three big prime values for Q, the
probability of getting a false positive is extremely low. This algorithm is fairly easy to
implement in linear time, and also to distribute. We also need to check that B is larger
than all the given digits, which we do in the same way as in the other presented solution.
This approach saves us the hassle of dealing with carries manually, which is the most error-prone
part of the algorithm, and also a small annoyance while distributing it.
