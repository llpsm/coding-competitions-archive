<h2>Flagpoles: Analysis</h2>

<p>
As we can see from the definition in the problem statement, a consecutive set of flagpoles having
collinear tips is equivalent to the corresponding input values forming an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression">arithmetic progression</a>.
This means the problem translates into finding the longest contiguous subsequence forming an
arithmetic progression. Since the difference between any two consecutive elements in the
progression is the same, we can simplify this further by considering an altered input: the list of
differences between consecutive elements. A contiguous subsequence of size <i>k</i> which is an
arithmetic progression in the input corresponds to a contiguous subsequence of size <i>k</i>-1 in
the altered input. After having a special case for an input with a single element, this poses no
additional problem as there is always an arithmetic progression of length at least 2.
</p><p>
From the paragraph above, we now have to solve a much easier problem: given a list of integers,
find the length of the longest consecutive subsequence of elements that are all equal.
From this point, we will focus on solving the altered problem. The result we look for can then
be found simply by adding 1 to the result of the altered problem.

<h3>A single-node solution</h3>

<p>
The problem is almost trivial on a single node in quadratic time, and a simple loop can also solve
it in linear time, as the following pseudocode illustrates:
</p><pre>
previous = first element of the altered input
current = best = 1
for each x in the altered input except the first:
  if x == previous:
    current = current + 1
    best = max(best, current)
  else:
    previous = x
    current = 1
</pre>

<h3>A distributed solution</h3>

<p>
While the single node solution is good enough to pass the Small dataset, we need to go sublinear to
get a shot at the Large set, as there isn't enough time to even read the entire input on a
single node.
</p><p>
The first thing to try, as it's common practice in Distributed Code Jam, is to partition the input
into 100 evenly-sized pieces and get each node to process one piece. If we do that, we can
immediately notice there are two distinct cases:
</p><ol>
  <li>The longest contiguous subsequence of equal numbers is all contained in one piece.</li>
  <li>It spans multiple pieces.</li>
</ol><p>
Case 1 is easy to resolve with our division strategy: each node will report to a master it's
internal result and the master will just take the maximum. However, this will overlook case 2,
so we need to do something extra. Examining the result for this case more closely, we can see that
the longest contiguous subsequence starts inside some node i, then covers nodes
<i>i</i>+1, <i>i</i>+2, ...,<i>j</i>-2, <i>j</i>-1 completely, and then finishes somewhere within
node <i>j</i>, for some pair of indices <i>i</i> &lt; <i>j</i> (if <i>j</i> = <i>i</i> + 1, then no
node is covered completely). That means that, for each node, only a prefix or suffix will be
important (in nodes where the all the elements in the split are equal, the coverage is both a
prefix and a suffix). Putting it all together, each node needs to calculate and report to a master:
</p><ul>
<li>An internal result (to cover case 1).</li>
<li>The leftmost and rightmost elements in its range.</li>
<li>The length of the largest prefix of elements equal to its leftmost element.</li>
<li>The length of the largest suffix of elements equal to its rightmost element.</li>
</ul><p>
With that information, the master can calculate the best option for case 2 by trying every possible
pair of nodes (since there are only 100): for each <i>i</i> &lt; <i>j</i>, we can consider a
solution if the rightmost element of <i>i</i> is equal to the leftmost element of <i>j</i>, and for
each k, <i>i</i> &lt; <i>k</i> &lt; <i>j</i>, the leftmost and rightmost element of <i>k</i> are
equal and equal to the other two, and the size of <i>k</i>'s longest suffix and prefix coincides
with its range length (that is, all elements inside node <i>k</i> are equal). In that case, a
possible result is the longest suffix from <i>i</i> + the longest prefix from <i>j</i> + the length
of the range for each each <i>k</i>. This part can be optimized to be linear in the number of
nodes, but there is no need for it, since the number of nodes is so small.
