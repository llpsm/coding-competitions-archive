<h3>Problem</h3>

<h2>Flagpoles</h2>
<p>
  Cody-Jamal, the famous conceptual artist, was called to design the new United Nations
headquarters. The entrance displays a single row of flagpoles with the flags of different countries.
Each flagpole is exactly 1 meter away from its neighbor(s). Since different nations have different
rules about how high their flags must be flown, the tips of the flagpoles may have different
heights.
</p><p>
  The scientists from the famous Detecting Collinearity Journal have become interested in the
flagpoles. In particular, they want to know the maximum number of consecutive flagpoles with tips
that are collinear. A set of contiguous flagpoles has collinear tips if there is a constant d
such that, for every pair of adjacent flagpoles in the set, the height of the right flagpole's tip
minus the height of the left flagpole's tip is equal to d. Notice that the condition is always
true for a set of up to 2 flagpoles.
</p><p>
For example, if the flagpoles' heights are 5, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 3, in left-to-right order, the
leftmost 2 flagpoles and the rightmost 3 flagpoles are examples of consecutive sets of flagpoles
with collinear tips. The flagpoles with heights 7 and 1, together with those in between them,
are another example. The leftmost 3 flagpoles, however, do not have collinear tips, so they do not
form such a set.
</p><p>
  Given the height in meters of each flagpole tip, in the left-to-right order in which they appear,
can you help the DCJ calculate the maximum size of a set of consecutive flagpoles with collinear
tips?

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library is called "flagpoles"; see the sample inputs below for examples in your
language. It defines two methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>GetNumFlagpoles()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number of flagpoles in the row.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.17 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetHeight(i)</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes exactly one 64-bit integer argument: a position i, 0 &le; i &lt;
      <code>GetNumFlagpoles()</code>.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the height, in meters, of the flagpole at the ith position from left
      to right. The ith flagpole is always i meters to the right of the 0th flagpole.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.17 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output one line with a single integer: the maximum number of consecutive flagpoles with collinear
top ends.
