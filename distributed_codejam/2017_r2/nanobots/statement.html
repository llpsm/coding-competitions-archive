<h3>Problem</h3>

<h2>Nanobots</h2>
<p>
  A group of medical researchers is working on a new treatment to fight bacteria. In the
  treatment, special nanobots are transferred into the patient's body, where they
  locate and trap any harmful bacteria. This allows the patient to get better, and the
  researchers can later retrieve the trapped bacteria for further study.
</p><p>
  Not any nanobot can trap any bacterium, though. A nanobot can be characterized by two traits:
  size and speed. A nanobot can only trap bacteria that are smaller than it (otherwise, the
  bacteria will not fit in the nanobot's cage) and also slower than it (otherwise, the bacteria can
  escape the nanobot). Formally, a nanobot with speed A and size B can trap a bacterium with speed
  C and size D if and only if A &gt; C and B &gt; D. The speeds and sizes of both nanobots and
  bacteria are in the inclusive range [1, <code>GetRange()</code>].
</p>
<p>
  You have a group of nanobots and you want to know how effective they are at trapping bacteria.
  Your goal is to find how many of the <code>GetRange()</code><sup>2</sup> possible bacteria get
  trapped by the team of nanobots. Unfortunately, you cannot directly examine the speed and size
  of your nanobots. You can only experiment by introducing a bacterium with a specific size and
  speed, and watching whether this bacterium gets trapped by the team of nanobots or not.
  A team of nanobots will trap a bacterium with speed C and size D if and only if there is at
  least one nanobot in the team that has both speed strictly greater than C and size strictly
  greater than D.
</p><p>
  You may carry out as many experiments of this sort as you want... within the allowed running time
  for the problem, of course! You can choose the speed and size of the bacteria in each experiment,
  and for each one, you receive one piece of data: whether or not the bacteria was trapped.
  Each experiment uses the full team of nanobots, and the same nanobot can catch bacteria in
  different experiments. Based on
  that information, you need to determine how many of the <code>GetRange()</code><sup>2</sup>
  possible bacteria would be trapped by the team of nanobots. (Because the speed can take any
  integer value in [1, <code>GetRange()</code>], and the same is true for the size, there are
  <code>GetRange()</code><sup>2</sup> possible bacteria.) Since the output can be a really big
  number, we only ask you to output the remainder of dividing the result by the prime
  10<sup>9</sup>+7 (1000000007).

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library is called "nanobots"; see the sample inputs below for examples in your
language. It defines three methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>GetNumNanobots()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the number of nanobots on the team.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.2 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetRange()</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes no argument.</li>
  <li>Returns a 64-bit integer: the maximum valid value for speeds and sizes of
    both bacteria and nanobots.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.2 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Experiment(c, d)</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Takes exactly two 64-bit integer arguments: a size c and a speed d,
    1 &le; c,d &le; <code>GetRange()</code>.</li>
  <li>Returns a char: <code>T</code> if a bacteria with size c and speed d is trapped by
    the nanobots, or <code>E</code> if it escapes.</li>
  <li>Expect each call to take 0.2 microseconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  Output one line with a single integer: how many of the different bacteria with both size and speed
  in the inclusive range [1, <code>GetRange()</code>] would be trapped by the nanobots,
  modulo the prime 10<sup>9</sup>+7 (1000000007). Two bacteria are considered different if and only
  if they have different speed and/or different size.

<h3>Limits</h3>

<code>Experiment(c, d)</code> is either uppercase <code>T</code> or uppercase <code>E</code>, for
  all c, d.<br/>
The results of <code>Experiment</code> are consistent with the same team of
<code>GetNumNanobots()</code> nanobots across all nodes. <br/>
It is possible that multiple nanobots might have the same size and speed.<br/>

<h4>Small dataset</h4>
