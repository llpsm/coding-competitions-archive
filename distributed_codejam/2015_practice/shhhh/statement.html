<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
You are at a reception. Along with a (huge) number of other people, you are seated at a round table, and listen to the speaker speak... and speak... and speak. You would like the speech to end, but that's not likely to happen, so you'd at least like to tell your friend &mdash; who sits somewhere else at the same table &mdash; how badly bored you are.<br/>
However, it's rude to speak loudly. So, you'll whisper to one of your two neighbours, asking them to pass the message along. They'll then whisper to the other neighbour, and so on, until the message reaches your friend. You now need to decide which neighbour to choose so the distance traveled by the message is as short as possible, and how long is it going to go.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
Each person at the table has a unique integer assigned, from 0 to <i>N</i>-1,
where <i>N</i> is the number of people at the table (including you and your
friend). You are assigned the identifier 0, and your friend is assigned the
identifier 1.<br/>
The input library will be called &quot;shhhh&quot;, see the sample inputs
below for examples in your language.
It will define three methods: GetN(), which
will return the number <i>N</i> of people at the table,
GetLeftNeighbour(i) for 0 &le; i &lt; <i>N</i>, which will return the
identifier of the left neighbour of the person with identifier <i>i</i>, and
GetRightNeighbour(i) for 0 &le; i &lt; <i>N</i>, which will return the
identifier of the right neighbour of the person with identifier <i>i</i>.<br/>
A single call to GetLeftNeighbour(i) or GetRightNeighbour(i) will take approximately 0.015 microseconds.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output one line, containing one word and one number, separated by a single space. The word should be "LEFT" if it is faster to pass the message to your left
neighbour, "RIGHT" if it is faster to pass the message to your right neighbour,
or "WHATEVER" if the distance is the same in both directions (quotes around all
words are for clarity only). The number should be the distance the message will
have to travel (that is, the number of people who will hear the message, including your friend, but not including you).
