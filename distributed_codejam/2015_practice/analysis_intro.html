The practice round for the Distributed Code Jam has ended. While the point was mostly to familiarize everybody with the system, we will provide standard editorials for the problems we used.

<i>Sandwich</i> was a relatively standard DP problem, with a rather simple distributed algorithm. <i>Majority</i> involved an adaptation of the Boyer-Moore majority algorithm, which parallelizes surprisingly well. <i>Shhhh</i> was an example how difficult graph problems become when you need to shard the solution. Finally, <i>Load Balance</i> involved taking a meet-in-the-middle algorithm and sharding it to run fast enough through local optimization or clever hashing.
