<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>
At your flat, you take turns in bringing the groceries in. Each day, one person
goes out and does the shopping for everybody who lives in the whole building.
Today it's your turn, you did the shopping, and all these bags are heavy!<br/>
You can't do much about the fact the bags are heavy &mdash; people depend on you
to bring the bags home. But they will be easier to carry if you distribute the
load equally between the left and the right hand. So, you look at all the bags
you have, and wonder whether it's possible to split them so that the weight of
the ones you'll carry in your left hand will be equal to the weight of those you
will carry in your right hand.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library will be called &quot;load_balance&quot;, see the sample inputs
below for examples in your language. It will define two methods: GetN(), which
will return the number of bags you have to carry, and GetWeight(i), which will
return the weight of the <i>i</i>th bag, for 0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;N.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output one string: &quot;IMPOSSIBLE&quot; if it is impossible to split the load
equally, or &quot;POSSIBLE&quot; if it is possible (quotes are for clarity only).<br/>
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
Each node will have access to 512MB of RAM, and a time limit of 4 seconds.<br/>
1 &le; GetWeight(i) &le; 10<sup>15</sup> for all i with 0 &le; i &lt; GetN().<br/>
</p>

<h4>Small input</h4>
<p>
Your solution will run on 10 nodes.<br/>
1 &le; GetN() &le; 30.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Large input</h4>
<p>
Your solution will run on 100 nodes.<br/>
1 &le; GetN() &le; 52.<br/>
</p>
