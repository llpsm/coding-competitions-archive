<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
Your country is electing its president, and you are in charge of the new
electronic voting system. The citizens have voted, and now you
have to check if any of the candidates obtained a <i>majority</i> &mdash; that
is, if there is a candidate for whom more than half of the citizens voted.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input library will be called &quot;majority&quot;, see the sample inputs
below for examples in your language. It will define two methods: GetN(), which
will return the number of voting citizens <i>N</i>, and GetVote(i),
which will (for 0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;N) return the identifier of the candidate for whom
citizen <i>i</i> voted.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
If any candidate obtained a majority of the votes, output the identifier of that
candidate. Otherwise, output the string &quot;NO WINNER&quot; (quotes for
clarity only).<br/>
A single call to GetVote(i) will take approximately 0.025 microseconds.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
Each node will have access to 128MB of RAM, and a time limit of 3 seconds.<br/>
0 &le; GetVote(i) &le; 10<sup>9</sup> for all <i>i</i> with 0  &le; i &lt; N.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Small input</h4>
<p>
Your solution will run on 10 nodes.<br/>
1 &le; GetN() &le; 1000.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Large input</h4>
<p>
Your solution will run on 100 nodes.<br/>
1 &le; GetN() &le; 10<sup>9</sup>.<br/>
</p>
